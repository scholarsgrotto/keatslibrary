H. J. Jackson claims
            that only two of Keats’s annotated books contain notes that offer “serious critical commentary:” his <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> and his folio Shakespeare (191).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText"><span class="titleAttribution">Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</span>. 1623. Rpt. London, 1808. Owned by Keats House and stored in the London Metropolitan
                  Archives.</span></span> 
            
            In the latter, however, only five plays are marked by Keats and of these only two
            (<span class="titleAttribution">Troylus and Cressida</span> and <span class="titleAttribution">King Lear</span>) are marked throughout.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">According to Forman, “<span class="titleAttribution">The First Part of King Henry the Fourth</span> is marked only in the first eight pages . . . in <span class="titleAttribution">Romeo and Juliet</span> the markings extend over the first half of the play. . . . [and] in <span class="titleAttribution">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</span> there are but two pages” marked (5: 269n).</span></span>  
            
            The <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> volumes, by contrast, contain markings and annotations throughout the entirety of
            Milton’s poem. The book provides a remarkable record, not just of Keats’s response
            to one of his most important literary precursors, but of his reading practices, aesthetic
            tastes, and habits of mind more broadly.<br><br>
            
            Keats’s edition of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> was published in Edinburgh, printed for W. &amp; J. Deas, in duodecimo format.
            <span id="intro-1775ref" class="noteTooltip">(NOTE) <span class="noteTooltipText">Keats also possessed a 1775 edition of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> (8th ed., 2 vols., printed in London for J. Beercroft et al.), the first volume of
                  which is missing. On the inside front cover of the surviving second volume is written
                  in an ornate hand, “John Keats / 1810,” indicating that the book was probably given to the poet when he was a student at
                  John Clarke’s school (see Owings 42-43).  It contains no marginalia.</span></span> 
            
            Besides the text of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, this edition contains at the beginning of volume 1 a “<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=11">Life of Milton</a>” by Elijah Fenton, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=21">a postscript</a> that lists passages added to the 2nd, twelve-book edition of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, a Latin poem by Samuel Barrow, “<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=25">In Paradisum Amissam Summi Poetae Johannes Miltoni</a>,” Andrew Marvell’s poem “<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=27">On Paradise Lost</a>,” and Milton’s explanatory paragraph “<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=29">On the Verse</a>.” None of these items in the front matter is marked or annotated by Keats. The volumes
            also include six engraved illustrations of Milton’s poem. Five of these are after
            paintings by Henry Fuseli (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=33"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=44"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=45">Satan Calling Up His Legions</a> from book 1; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=36"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=82">Satan Encountering Death at Hell’s Gate, Sin Interposing</a> from book 2; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=33"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=143">Satan Starting from the Touch of Ithuriel’s Spear</a> from book 4; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=218">The Triumphant Messiah</a> from book 6; and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=384">The Explusion from Paradise</a> from book 12), and one is after William Hamilton (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=289">Eve Tempted</a> from book 9).  All are engraved by Daniel Lizars, a painter and engraver who worked
            in Edinburgh.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">The artists are not identified in Keats’s edition; I was able to do so by consulting
                  Pointon 198; Ravenhall 529-89; and Weinglass 202-06.  Titles for each illustration derive from Weinglass and Pointon.  Information about Daniel Lizars is from <span class="titleAttribution">The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography online</span> (accessed 9 Nov. 2018).</span></span> <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=190">The title page vignette of Eve handing Adam an apple</a> has not been identified.<br><br>
            
            Keats’s marginalia in the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> volumes consist of nineteen notes and extensive markings: underlining (single, double,
            and triple) as well as vertical lines in the margin (also ranging from single, double,
            to triple lines, indicating varying degrees of intensity in Keats’s response to particular
            passages).  In addition, on the flyleaf of volume two Keats wrote a draft of his sonnet
            <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=188">To Sleep</a>. Markings occur in every book of the poem, though both notes and markings are most
            extensive in the earlier books and become less frequent in the last three.  This pattern
            could reflect either that Keats found the beginning of the poem more significant and
            engaging than the end or that he simply became less committed to recording his responses
            as he worked his way through it.<br><br>
            
            
            <h4>Transmission and Publication History</h4>Keats gave these volumes to Maria Dilke before he left for Italy; the second volume
            is inscribed “<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=190">M<sup>rs</sup> Dilke from / her sincere friend / J. Keats</a>.” Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> remained in the Dilke family throughout the nineteenth century.  Both volumes contain
            C. W. Dilke’s bookplate, and they eventually were donated to the Hampstead Libraries
            by his grandson Sir Charles Dilke as part of the valuable Dilke bequest. They now
            belong to Keats House in Hampstead and are housed in the London Metropolitan Archives.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia have long been valued by those interested in Keats, starting with his
            family and friends. George Keats copied eleven of the nineteen notes onto the flyleaf
            of his own edition of Milton’s poem, and Marianne Reynolds went to the trouble of
            reproducing not only the notes but all of Keats’s markings into her personal copy
            of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">The information about Mariane Reynolds comes from Forman 5: 291. The whereabouts of Marianne Reynolds’s and George Keats’s copies of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> are currently unknown.             
                  </span></span> 
            
            When Keats gave the volumes to Maria Dilke, the significance of the gift resided in
            the marginalia rather than the printed text (at least one copy of which she and her
            husband already owned), and he would have known that his commentary would be read
            by Maria, her husband Charles, and most likely others in their circle.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Keats House owns a copy of <span class="titleAttribution">The Poetical Works of John Milton</span> (London 1811) that belonged to Charles Dilke, which is filled with his notes and
                  markings. Keats is likely to have seen Dilke’s Milton, which may have served as one
                  model for his own annotated copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>.  Another model may have been Benjamin Bailey’s copy of Milton, discussed below.
                  
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            The eleven notes George transcribed were the first examples of Keats’s marginalia
            to be published, in the form of a letter by James Freeman Clarke to the editor of
            the American periodical <span class="titleAttribution">The Dial</span> for April 1843. Clarke explains in his letter that he was “permitted to copy” the notes from the fly-leaf of a <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> George Keats possessed (499).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">See also the letter from James Freeman Clarke published in the article “George Keats” in <span class="titleAttribution">The Athenaeum</span>(4 Jan. 1873).                  
                  </span></span> 
            
            Richard Monckton Milnes reprinted the <span class="titleAttribution">Dial</span> notes in his 1848 biography of Keats, and in an 1872 <span class="titleAttribution">Athenaeum</span> article, Sir Charles Dilke provided the eight marginal comments not printed by Clarke
            and Milnes.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">A note written by Sir Charles Dilke on <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=4">the inside front cover of volume 1</a> of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> refers to the article he published in <span class="titleAttribution">The Athenaeum</span>.                   
                  </span></span> 
            
            Beginning in 1883, Harry Buxton Forman published all of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> notes in his editions of Keats’s poetry and prose, concluding with the 1938-39 Hampstead Edition, which for many years was the standard source for Keats’s annotations in Milton and
            several other works. The notes have subsequently been included in a number of editions
            of Keats’s poetry, indicating their continued importance for scholars and students.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">See editions by John Barnard 517-26; Elizabeth Cook 336-45; Susan J. Wolfson 225-37.  Joseph Anthony Wittreich, Jr., also prints the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> notes in his valuable collection, <span class="titleAttribution">The Romantics on Milton</span> 553-60.
                  </span></span> 
            It was not until Beth Lau’s 1998 <span class="titleAttribution">Keats’s Paradise Lost</span>, however, that Keats’s extensive markings as well as his notes were made available
            in a print transcription.  These allow scholars to share the almost line-by-line experience
            of reading Milton’s poem from Keats’s perspective.
            
            <br><br>
            
            The current digital edition of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> improves on Lau’s transcription of the marginalia in a number of ways.  First, as
            an open-source website, it makes this valuable material more accessible than it is
            in Lau’s book, which is chiefly to be found in academic libraries.  In addition, readers
            can now see the actual appearance on the page of Keats’s notes and markings and their
            relationship to particular passages of Milton’s poem.  This edition also includes
            the entirety of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, not just the passages Keats marked, as in Lau’s book.  The passages Keats did not
            mark can themselves be revealing, indicating what sections and aspects of the poem
            were less interesting—literally unremarkable—to him.  Finally, Keats’s markup can
            now be analyzed computationally, an affordance which might seem superfluous for a
            single text, but which could become significant as more marginalia are systematically
            digitized and encoded.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">As, for example, <a href="http://melvillesmarginalia.org/">Melville’s Marginalia Online</a> is attempting to do.  Besides its transcription of the marginalia, Lau’s book contains
                  commentary on Keats’s notes and markings and on the practice of writing marginalia
                  in the early nineteenth century.  Much of the information in the present Introduction
                  and the explanatory notes for this digital edition derive from Lau’s study, reprinted
                  with the permission of UP of Florida.
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            
            <h4>Dating the Marginalia</h4>Keats did not specify when he read and annotated his copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, and different dates have been proposed (see Lau 23), but the bulk of evidence points to early 1818 for this activity.  Benjamin Bailey
            told Richard Monckton Milnes in 1849 that when Keats visited him at Oxford in September
            1817, he “was . . . far more enamoured of the beauties of Spenser &amp; the Faery Queen” than of Milton’s epic and had not yet begun “[t]he subsequent study of Milton [that] gave his mind a mighty addition of energy
            &amp; manly vigour.” This study Bailey, a self-styled “great student of Milton,” apparently urged Keats to undertake, perhaps showing Keats as a model his own edition
            of Milton “with passages marked in ink, &amp; similar passages cited &amp; referred to, &amp; some M.S. notes.” Certainly, as Bailey explains, “We had much talk of Milton when Keats was at Oxford” (<span class="titleAttribution">The Keats Circle</span> 2: 283, 296), and this visit seems to have marked the beginning of Keats’s serious interest in
            <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>.  References to the poem appear in a 22 November 1817 letter to Bailey (Keats, <span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 185), and in January 1818 Keats wrote his poem “Lines on Seeing a Lock of Milton’s Hair,” in which he salutes Milton as “Chief of organic numbers” and characterizes himself as a worshipful votary offering “a burnt sacrifice of verse” to the elder poet’s “sacred and ennobled hearse” (1, 8-9).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Keats’s poems are quoted from <span class="titleAttribution">The Poems of John Keats</span>, ed. Jack Stillinger, hereafter cited as <span class="titleAttribution">Poems</span>.
                  </span></span> 
            
            In a 3 February 1818 letter to Reynolds, Keats compares modern poets unfavorably to
            Shakespeare and Milton (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 223-25), and in a 27 April 1818 letter to Reynolds, Keats says, “I long to feast upon old Homer as we have upon Shakespeare. and as I have lately upon
            Milton” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 274). The term “feast” implies attentive, in-depth reading of the sort reflected by the markings and annotations
            in the 1807 <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> volumes.  Comments on Milton in 24 March and 3 May 1818 letters also point to this
            period as one in which Milton was prominent in Keats’s thoughts.  It is therefore
            likely that Keats began reading and marking his copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in late 1817 or early 1818 and continued into the spring of that year.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Some evidence does connect Keats’s reading of Milton’s poem with other periods of
            his life.  In the fall of 1818 Keats wrote his epic fragment <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span>, which is heavily indebted to <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in structure, theme, and style.  Although Miltonic elements in <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span> could derive from an earlier reading of the poem, the extent of influence suggests
            a saturation in Milton that could be consonant with close reading and marking of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> at this time.  One specific connection between this period and Keats’s marginalia
            occurs in a 21 September 1818 letter to Dilke. “I wish I could say Tom was any better,” Keats writes. “His identity presses upon me so all day that I am obliged to go out—and although I
            intended to have given some time to study alone I am obliged to write, and plunge
            into abstract images to ease myself of his countenance his voice and feebleness—so
            that I live now in a continual fever—it must be poisonous to life although I feel
            well.  Imagine ‘the hateful siege of contraries’” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 368-69).  This letter, which announces the composition of <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span>, quotes <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=270"><span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> 9.121-22</a>, a passage distinguished by both underscoring and triple marginal lines in Keats’s
            copy of the poem.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">The abbreviation <span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> will hereafter be used for references to book and line numbers in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>. 
                  </span></span> 
            A few weeks later, Keats underlined the words “Poor Tom” in his folio edition of Shakespeare’s <span class="titleAttribution">King Lear</span> and wrote in the margin, “Sunday evening, Oct. 4, 1818” (W. J. Bate 390).  The marking of the lines in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> and quotation of them in his letter to Dilke seem a parallel example of Keats finding
            words to express his own painful feelings about his dying brother in a text he is
            reading at this time.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Greg Kucich notes that markings probably made by Keats in Charles Brown’s Spenser
                  volumes habitually flag passages describing pain and suffering, which express Keats’s
                  own anguish in the summer of 1820 when the volumes were annotated (“A Lamentable Lay” 13-22).   
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            A draft of <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=188">Sonnet to Sleep</a> is written on the flyleaf of volume 2 of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, and this poem is dated late April 1819 (<span class="titleAttribution">Poems</span> 646). In addition, references to the fall of Adam and Eve and their expulsion from Eden
            occur in March and April 1819 letters (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 79, 101). Keats was almost certainly reading <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in the summer of 1819, for he tells both Bailey and Reynolds in August of that year
            that “the Paradise Lost becomes a greater wonder” to him (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 146; see also 139). A 31 August 1819 letter to Taylor slightly misquotes <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=138"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 4.683</a>—“responsive each to other’s note”—which is underscored in Keats’s copy of the poem (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 153).  Finally, in 21 and 24 September letters to Reynolds and to George and Georgiana
            Keats, respectively, Keats rejects Milton’s language as artificial and claims, “I have but lately stood on my guard against Milton.  Life to him would be death to
            me” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 212; see also 167).  These statements may signal the end of Keats’s initial worshipful attitude toward
            the elder poet, though not of the latter’s impact on Keats’s poetry.  That Keats continued
            to draw upon <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> during this period is suggested by a number of parallels scholars have detected between
            Milton’s poem and both <span class="titleAttribution">Lamia</span> (written July and August 1819) and <span class="titleAttribution">The Fall of Hyperion</span> (July-September 1819). Indeed, both Stuart Sperry (<span class="titleAttribution">Keats the Poet</span> 313-14) and David Fairer (164) believe that <span class="titleAttribution">The Fall of Hyperion</span> reflects a more successful assimilation of Milton’s influence than does the earlier
            <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span>.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Scholars who have argued for parallels between <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> and <span class="titleAttribution">Lamia</span> include Gordon 435-37, 440-41; Stephenson; and Allott 616-48. Numerous works treat <span class="titleAttribution">The Fall of Hyperion</span> in relation to Milton, but, besides Sperry and Fairer, see especially Jonathan Bate, “Keats’s Two Hyperions.”

            On pages in which both markings and notes appear, it is clear that the markings were
            done first, for the annotations often curve around them (see, for example, notes in
            response to <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=34"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=53"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 1.598-99</a> and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=36"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=77">2.546-52</a>). In addition, some notes refer to later passages of the poem.  For example, the
            first note, written on <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=9">the half-title page of volume 1</a>, quotes “But his face / Deep Scars of thunder had entrench’d &amp;[c.]” from <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=34"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=53"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 1.600-01</a>, on page 20 of Keats’s copy.  A note praising Milton’s use of the word “vale” in <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=44">1.321</a> also cites “the Next mention of Vale” in <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=36"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=77">2.546-47</a>. More significantly, the note extolling the Ceres and Proserpine passage in <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=126">4.268-72</a> cites as another example of “very extraordinary beauty” in the poem “Nor could the Muse defend her son,” from <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=224">7.37-38</a>.  Similarly, a note in book 7 describing Milton’s technique of “stationing” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=195"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=234">volume 2, pages 42-43</a> of Keats’s copy) quotes “sagacious of his Quarry” from <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=312">10.281</a>.  These notes obviously were written with later passages clearly in mind. Keats may
            have initially read through the entire poem marking significant passages and then
            immediately have begun a second reading during which he wrote his notes; he may have
            written some notes during his initial reading and some later; or he may have written
            all the notes at a later period than that in which he marked the poem. 
            <br><br>
            
            Another possibility is that Keats remembered later passages of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> from a much earlier reading. Keats was familiar with the poem before he read and
            annotated his 1807 copy.  As mentioned previously (<a href="#intro-1775ref">see note to first sentence of second paragraph</a>), Keats possessed a 1775 edition of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> inscribed “John Keats / 1810,” at which time he was a student at John Clarke’s school. In the verse epistle “To Charles Cowden Clarke,” written in September 1816, Keats praises his friend and former schoolmaster for
            teaching him to appreciate “Miltonian storms, and more, Miltonian tenderness / Michael in arms, and more, meek
            Eve’s fair slenderness” (58-59). In addition, a number of scholars, beginning with Richard Woodhouse, have identified
            allusions to <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in Keats’s early poems, including “Imitation of Spenser,” “Calidore,” “To one who has been long in city pent,” “How many bards gild the lapses of time,” “Sleep and Poetry,” and <span class="titleAttribution">Endymion</span>.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">For allusions to <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in “Imitation of Spenser” and “To one who has been long in city pent” see Sperry, “Richard Woodhouse’s Interleaved and Annotated Copy” 144-45, 149-50; for “How Many Bards” see Gleckner; for “Calidore,” “Sleep and Poetry,” and <span class="titleAttribution">Endymion</span> see Gordon. 
                  </span></span> 
            
            In Bailey’s account, Keats was not unacquainted with Milton’s poetry in 1817 but did
            not sufficiently appreciate it.                 
            
            <br><br>
            
            It is unlikely, however, that Keats’s memory of the later passages he quotes in his
            <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> annotations derived from his schoolboy reading of the poem.  Benjamin Bailey’s comment
            to Monkton Milnes suggests that Keats’s impression of Milton before fall of 1817 was
            very different from the one conveyed in his <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia. In addition, the references to later passages in Keats’s notes seem consistent
            with a fresh reading of the poem and effort to record his response to the work as
            a whole, as Keats points out what he sees as recurring patterns and techniques (e.g.,
            multiple instances of “extraordinary beauty” and of “stationing”).  Both Bailey’s and Keats’s references to the latter’s “study” of and “feast[ing] on” Milton in 1818 imply a methodical, focused course of reading that may well have
            involved two sessions, the first dedicated to an initial marking of arresting passages
            and the second, immediately following, in which Keats expressed in his notes some
            of his major insights into and impressions of the poem.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Jackson believes “It is quite likely that the marking was done first, the extended note-writing later” (194).
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            Overall, the surviving evidence suggests early 1818 for Keats’s initial, sustained
            reading and annotating of the entire poem.  Nonetheless, Keats may have added some
            marginalia at later periods when letters and poems suggest that he was rereading <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>. If Keats did read and record his impressions of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in the winter and spring of 1818, the fall of 1818, and the spring and summer of
            1819, we should have to conclude that close engagement with the poem was intimately
            connected with all the most creative periods of Keats’s life.
            <br><br>
            
            
            <h4>Keats’s Style of Marking</h4>Scholars who have studied Keats’s marginalia have attempted to identify a coherent
            system in his use of underscoring and vertical lines in the margins.  Most claim that
            vertical lines identify passages Keats found significant for their content, involving
            ideas, emotional power, or character development, whereas underscoring highlights
            more detailed effects such as striking language, imagery, or other poetic techniques.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">See Spurgeon 24-27; White 93-94; Kucich, “A Lamentable Lay” 9-11.
                  </span></span> 
            
            This may be Keats’s general practice, though as Kucich says, he did not adhere to
            it with “systematic rigidity”(“A Lamentable Lay” 9n22).  Numerous passages in Keats’s copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> are both underscored and marked with marginal lines, seemingly as a way to give more
            emphasis than either type of marking alone could convey (see, for example, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=126">4.271-72</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=141">797-98</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=212">6.654-55</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=270">9.121-22</a>).  
            
            <br><br>
            
            Jackson claims that Keats followed a system of marking in which both underscoring
            and vertical lines denote appreciation of passages, whereas crosses indicate disapproval
            (182).  Two crosses (or “X’s”) appear in the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia, but only one of these is aligned with a critical remark. Alongside <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=268">9.43-47</a> (also marked with a vertical line), where Milton expresses his fear that “an age too late” may “damp my intended wing,” Keats makes an “X” and then adds the question, written sideways in the left margin
            and preceded with an “X,” “Had not Shakspeare [sic] liv’d?,” challenging Milton’s claim that the age in which he lived was unfavorable to poetry.
            By contrast, an “X” beside <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=108"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 3.488</a> (“Blows them traverse ten thousand leagues awry”) is keyed to a note that conveys admiration for the way “This part in its sound is unaccountably expressive of the description.” If Jackson’s point about Keats’s use of crosses is unsupported by the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia, however, she is accurate in characterizing them as predominantly “of the booster variety,” drawing attention to passages and effects Keats admired (187).  Besides the example cited above, only one other note in the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> volumes is critical.  In the margin of <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=99">volume 1, page 65</a>, containing part of the dialogue between God and Christ about the fate of mankind,
            Keats writes, “Hell is finer than this.”
            
            <br><br>
            
            Two other patterns in the markings can be noted. First, when underscoring lines, Keats
            frequently lifts his pen and then resumes, leaving a break in his underscoring. These
            breaks typically occur at caesuras and indicate where Keats paused in his reading
            of Milton’s lines.  (These breaks are not shown in the transcription of the marginalia,
            but readers can see them in the page scans.) Second, the vertical lines Keats draws
            are typically in the left margin, alongside the first words in the lines of poetry
            he highlights, but in one instance he draws a vertical line in the right margin (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=247">8.93-94</a>).  This is probably because a phrase he also underscores in line 94 (“barren shines”) is near the end of the line.  Another passage on the same page (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=247">8.61-62</a>) is highlighted with the usual vertical stroke in the left margin.  It does seem
            somewhat odd, however, that Keats was impelled to make a line in the right margin
            only once in his reading of the entire poem.  
            <br><br>
            
            In a 21 September 1819 letter to Reynolds in which he announces that he has abandoned
            <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span> because “there were too many Miltonic inversions in it,” Keats proposes that his friend “pick out some lines from <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span> and put a mark X to the false beauty proceeding from art, and one [draws double vertical
            lines] to the true voice of feeling.” In the next sentence, however, Keats confesses, “Upon my soul ‘twas imagination I cannot make out the distinction—Every now and then
            there is a Miltonic intonation—But I cannot make the division properly” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 167). In this passage Keats announces a system of marking (basically the one Jackson
            says he follows) and then immediately rescinds it as unworkable. Along the same lines,
            he may have set about annotating his copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> with a particular strategy in mind but then have deviated from it upon occasion,
            as his responses to particular passages dictated. Readers of this digital edition
            of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> may discern hitherto unnoticed rationales for Keats’s annotating practices.
            <br><br>
            
            
            <h4>Themes and Patterns in the Marginalia: Descriptive Passages</h4>Numerous patterns can be noted in the passages and aspects of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> that Keats does and does not mark or comment on in his notes.  One of the most conspicuous
            of these is a tendency to highlight descriptive passages. He frequently flags passages
            describing characters’ facial expressions. Examples include the account of Satan’s
            face, which “Deep scars of thunder had intrench’d” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=53">1.600-01</a>), a line that is not only underscored but also quoted in the first of Keats’s notes,
            written on <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=9">the half-title page of volume 1</a>. Similarly, “round [Satan] throws his baleful eyes” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=36">1.56</a>) is underscored and quoted in two notes: to <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=35"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 1.1-22</a> and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=96">3.26-50</a>.  Keats also marks the passage in book 4 when Satan, disguised as an angel, first
            sees Eden and is torn with conflicting emotions, so that “each passion dimm’d his face, / Thrice changed with pale, ire, envy, and despair;
            / Which marr’d his borrow’d visage” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=122">4.114-16</a>). A few lines below this passage, the angel Uriel “on the Assyrian mount / Saw him [Satan] disfigured” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=122">4.126-27</a>); these lines are distinguished by both underscoring and triple marginal lines and
            are also quoted in Keats’s note on <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=195"><a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=235"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 7.422-23</a>.  Keats also marks passages describing the facial expressions of Chaos (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=90">2.988-90</a>), Christ (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=102">3.266-67</a>), and the angel Raphael (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=260">8.560</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=262">618-20</a>), among others.  
            <br><br>
            
            In the initial description of Adam and Eve, Keats underscores the section on their
            faces and hair (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=127">4.300-11</a>), but he frequently highlights passages that depict them at full length.  For example,
            he underscores Satan’s view of “Eve separate” tending her flowers (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=279">9.424-37</a>).  Further on in the climactic temptation scene, Keats marks Adam’s anxious expectation
            of Eve’s return and his sight of her approaching with “A bough of fairest fruit” in her hand (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=292">9.838-54</a>), as well as Adam’s reaction to her account of having eaten from the forbidden tree:
            
            <br>
            <span class="blockQuotation">Astonied [he] stood and blank, while horror chill<br>
            Ran through his veins, and all his joints relax’d;<br>
            From his slack hand the garland wreath’d for Eve<br>
            Down dropt, and all the faded roses shed:<br>
            Speechless he stood and pale.<br>
             (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=293">9.890-94</a>)</span><br>
            
            
            In book 10, Adam longs for death, and Keats underscores his posture of despair: “On the ground / Outstretch’d he lay, on the cold ground; and oft / Cursed his creation” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=327">10.850-52</a>).
            
            <br><br>
            
            In a note responding to <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=235"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 7.422-23</a>, Keats praises what he calls Milton’s “<span style="font-style:italic;">stationing or statu[a]ry</span>.” Milton, writes Keats, “is not content with simple description, he must station—Thus here, we not only see
            how the Birds ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">with clang despised the ground</span>’ but we see them ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">under a cloud in prospect</span>’ So we see Adam ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">Fair indeed and tall—under a plantane</span>’ and so we see Satan ‘<span style="font-style:italic;">disfigured—on the Assyrian Mount</span>.’” As Nancy Goslee explains, the term “stationing” derives from theories of the visual arts and refers to a static composition of one
            or more figures “caught in a suspended, significant moment” or positioned within a particular setting (205-06).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">See also Ian Jack 48-49, 141-42, 162ff. 
                  </span></span> 
            Keats seems to have experienced <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> largely as a series of pictures or tableaus, whether close-up portraits or more distanced
            views of complete figures posed in relation to their surroundings.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Keats also frequently highlights descriptions of settings in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>. The extended initial description of Eden in book 4 is heavily marked (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=123">4.132-68</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=125">225-30</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=125">237-50</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=126">254-81</a>). In these passages, Keats departs from the visual emphasis of most of the marked
            lines describing characters and responds to various sensory impressions. For example,
            Keats frequently marks references to mild, balmy, sweet-smelling air, as in accounts
            of “the soft delicious air,” “the buxom air, embalm’d / With odorus,” and the “pure, now purer air” of Paradise, where “gentle gales / Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense / Native perfumes” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=73">2.400</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=86">842-43</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=123">4.153</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=123">156-58</a>). Keats also underscores the famous simile describing the pleasure of a city dweller
            who
            <br>
            <span class="blockQuotation">Forth issuing on a summer’s morn, to breathe<br>
            Among the pleasant villages and farms<br>
            Adjoin’d, from each thing met conceives delight;<br>
            The smell of grain, or tedded grass, or kine,<br>
            Or dairy, each rural sight, each rural sound.<br>
             (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=279">9.447-51</a>)
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Keats does not mark the well-known opening line of this simile—“As one who long in populous city pent” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=279">9.445</a>)—which is considered a source for his 1816 sonnet “To one who has been long in city pent.” Perhaps the line was so familiar to Keats that he did not consider it worth singling
                  out for special attention.</span></span> </span><br>
            <br>
            
            Keats does not note only pleasant odors, however.  He also underscores “Asmodëus with the fishy fume” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=124">4.168</a>) and the passage in which Death “snuff’d the smell / Of mortal change on Earth”(<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=311">10.272-73</a>; see also <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=312">10.279-81</a>).  The lines just quoted have been linked to <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span> 1.167-68, in which the old sun god “still snuff’d the incense, teeming up / From man.”
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Allott 406n.
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            Leigh Hunt reported that “Keats . . . observed to me, that Milton, in various parts of his writings, has shown
            himself a bit of an epicure, and loves to talk of good eating” (<span class="titleAttribution">Autobiography</span> 2: 209). Hunt does not mention what particular passages from Milton Keats cited, but a number
            of lines describing eating, appetite, and taste are marked in Keats’s copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>. The account of the meal Eve prepares for Adam and Raphael, which has been linked
            to the food Porphyro prepares for Madeline in <span class="titleAttribution">The Eve of St. Agnes</span> and the half-eaten meal the speaker discovers at the beginning of <span class="titleAttribution">The Fall of Hyperion</span>, is heavily underscored (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=160">5.303-07</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=161">326-27</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=161">341-49</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=162">367-70</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=163">391-95</a>).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">Gordon (445) and Watkins (21-22) compare the food preparations in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> to those in <span class="titleAttribution">The Eve of St. Agnes</span>.

                  </span></span> 
            
            Keats also marks passages describing the angels’ eating habits and digestive systems
            (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=164">5.434-43</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=169">630-39</a>), as well as one in which Adam tells Raphael that the latter’s discourse is sweeter
            “Than fruits of palm-tree pleasantest to thirst / And hunger both, from labour, at
            the hour / Of sweet repast” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=251">8.212-14</a>).  The role of appetite in the temptation scene likewise is noted.  Keats underscores
            a passage in which the serpent tells Eve that, as he approached the tree of knowledge,
            <br>
            <span class="blockQuotation"> . . . from the boughs a savoury odour blown,<br>
            Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense<br>
            Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats<br>
            Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even,<br>
            Unsuck’d of lamb or kid, that tend their play.<br>
             (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=283">9.579-83</a>)</span><br>
            
            Keats also underscores the lines on Eve: “Greedily she ingorged without restraint, / And knew not eating death” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=290">9.791-92</a>).  
            
            
            <br><br>
            
            Just as he notes both sweet and rank odors, however, Keats also marks foul as well
            as pleasant eating experiences in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> (Eve’s eating of fruit from the tree of knowledge could of course be considered both
            pleasant and unpleasant). Several lines are underscored describing the disgust of
            the fallen angels in hell when they eat fruit that turns to ashes in their mouths:
            “which the offended taste / With spattering noise rejected” and “With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=320">10.566-67</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=320">569</a>).  Keats also underscores the grim passage in which Death, learning that he will
            gain access to all living things on earth after the Fall, “Grinn’d horrible a ghastly smile, to hear / His famine should be fill’d, and bless’d
            his maw / Destined to that good hour” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=86">2.846-48</a>).
            
            <br><br>
            
            Keats’s markings also reflect a sensitivity to sound imagery, both somber or sublime
            and sweet and melodious.  In the first category, Keats marks passages describing thunder
            (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=40">1.174-78</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=75">2.476-77</a>), the echoing of Satan’s voice in hell (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=44">1.314-15</a>), organ music (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=56">1.706-09</a>), “The sound of blustering winds” in “hollow rocks” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=70">2.285-90</a>), the sound of trumpets (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=76">2.516-18</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=196">6.59-60</a>), “The voice of God” after the Fall (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=307">10.97-99</a>), and “The brazen throat of war” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=358">11.713</a>). In addition, the single word “noise” is underscored in <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=90">2.957</a>. Among the soothing and celestial sounds Keats marks, one finds references to the
            fallen angels singing (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=77">2.546-54</a>), to angels in heaven playing musical instruments and singing (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=105">3.365-68</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=167">5.546-48</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=170">655-57</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=239">7.594-600</a>), to music of the spheres (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=169">5.625-27</a>), and to nightingales (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=96">3.38-40</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=140">4.771</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=259">8.518-19</a>).
            
            
            <br><br>
            
            Keats also appears to have relished the euphony or sound effects of Milton’s verse.
            As previously mentioned, a note on <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=108"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 3.488</a>—“Blows them traverse ten thousand leagues awry”—comments approvingly, “This part in its sound is unaccountably expressive of the description.” One pattern in Keats’s marking that also suggests an appreciation for the sound
            of words is his frequent underscoring of lists of names and place names.  For example,
            Keats underscores
            <br>
            <span class="blockQuotation"> . . . yet had his [Dagon’s] temple high<br>
            Rear’d in Azotus, dreaded through the coast<br>
            Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon,<br>
            And Accaron and Gaza’s frontier bounds.<br>
            Him follow’d Rimmon, whose delightful seat<br>
            Was fair Damascus, on the fertile banks.<br>
            Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams.<br>
              (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=49">1.463-69</a>)</span><br>
            
            Marked passages containing similar lists of euphonious names include <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=47">1.392-411</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=52">576-87</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=107">3.431-39</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=125">4.210-14</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=126">268-81</a>; <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=316">10.431-36</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=323">695-706</a>; and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=349">11.386-411</a>.  The passage in <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=323">10.695-706</a> contains a reference to “Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds / From Serraliona,” which Keats quotes in his 3 May 1818 letter to Reynolds (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 276). Leigh Hunt wrote an essay on the “Originality of Milton’s Harmonious Use of Proper Names,” in which he celebrates Milton’s “fondness for heaping together those sonorous proper names, which . . . are so managed
            as to charm and exalt the ear with an organ-like music,” passages Hunt characterizes as “islands of poetical beauty” (“My Books” 387, 392).  This essay was written after Keats’s death, but Hunt may have shared his appreciation
            of “harmonious” names in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in conversation with Keats.  Or, as with Keats’s remark on Milton’s love of good
            eating, Keats may have alerted Hunt to the pleasing sound effects of the poem’s lists
            of proper names.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Keats’s habit of marking passages notable for striking images or poetic use of language
            has been noted by others who have studied his marginalia in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> and other works.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">See for example Caroline Spurgeon (17), Stuart Ende (88-89), R. S. White (33-37 and passim), and Jonathan Bate (<span class="titleAttribution">Shakespeare and the English Romantic Imagination</span> 179), along with Shears and Kucich, cited below.
                  </span></span> 
            Indeed, one of the most characteristic features of Keats’s reading of poetry, as revealed
            by his marginalia in both Shakespeare’s plays and <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, is a tendency to focus on descriptive passages and felicitous phrases and to neglect
            passages concerned with central ideas, plot, and character development.  One of the
            ways this neglect is conveyed in the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia is an absence of interest in characters’ spoken dialogue.  Very few of
            the major speeches or conversations in the poem—which are key in expressing the characters’
            psychology and motivation, important stages in the narrative, and central themes and
            motifs—are marked by Keats.  In fact, he often marks lines leading up to a speech
            and then ceases when it begins.  Thus in book 1, the description of Satan before he
            addresses his assembled host is heavily marked, but the address itself—<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=53">lines 622-62</a>—is left clean.  In the council of hell scene in book 2, the introductions of Belial
            and Beelzebub are underscored (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=65">2.109-13</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=70">302-09</a>), as are the accounts of audience response to Mammon’s and Satan’s speeches (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=70">2.285-90</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=75">476-77</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=75">488-93</a>), but very little in the speeches themselves is highlighted.  Only <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=97">lines 87-88</a> and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=102">259</a> are underscored in the conversation between God and Christ in book 3.  In book 4,
            several lines (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=119">15-18</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=120">27-31</a>) leading up to Satan’s first soliloquy are marked, as are the three lines immediately
            following the soliloquy (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=122">114-16</a>), but among the eighty-one lines that make up this dramatic speech itself, only <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=121">73</a> and <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=122">96-97</a> are distinguished by Keats’s pen strokes.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Numerous examples of this tendency could be cited.  Little of the conversations between
            God and Raphael, Raphael and Adam, Satan and his army, Christ and God, or God and
            Adam is marked in books 5-8 (though Keats does mark passages where Raphael as narrator
            recounts to Adam the war in heaven and the creation of heaven and earth).  Likewise
            in the climactic book 9, few passages in the key conversations—between Adam and Eve
            at the beginning of the book, between Eve and Satan, or between Adam and Eve after
            her and then his fall—are marked, though intervening descriptive passages frequently
            are.  For example, the serpent’s movements and appearance as he leads Eve to the tree
            of knowledge are heavily marked (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=284">9.631-43</a>, <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=285">664-78</a>), but the ensuing temptation speech is completely untouched by Keats’s pen.  As noted
            previously, in book 10 Keats’s marks the lines describing Adam lying “Outstretch’d . . . on the cold ground” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=328">10.851</a>) but not the preceding soliloquy in which Adam wonders why he was created and longs
            for death (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=324">10.720-844</a>). Keats clearly seems more interested in what characters convey through their facial
            expressions and “stationing” in relation to their surroundings than through their words.
            <br><br>
            
            Some critics believe that Keats’s interest in imagery and sound effects to the neglect
            of broader thematic and structural elements in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> and other works reflects a selective reading of poetry that has problematic implications
            for Keats’s own work.  Jonathan Bate states that Keats’s tendency to focus on “fine Phrases” in his reading of Shakespeare and other writers may be one of the reasons why “many of Keats’s poems lack organization and discrimination on a larger scale” (<span class="titleAttribution">Shakespeare and the English Romantic Imagination</span> 200-01).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">“Fine Phrases” is quoted from the 14 August 1819 letter in which Keats tells Bailey, “I look upon fine Phrases like a Lover.” This statement comes immediately after the remark, “Shakspeare [sic] and the <span class="titleAttribution">paradise Lost</span> every day become greater wonders to me” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 2: 139).
                  </span></span>   
            
            Jonathan Shears claims that Keats’s “privileging of parts or fragments” (8), “delight in the music of Milton’s verse” (163), and emphasis on “pictorial scenes” (172) at the expense of “the logical progression of the argument” (163), constitute a significant misreading of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> that helps to explain why Keats could not finish <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span>.  Unlike Milton, Keats had no “presiding argument, or established symbolic order, of his own” to underpin his epic poem, and his disregard for key narrative features such as
            transitions and patterns of cause and effect translate into a lack of meaningful action
            in <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span> (171, 173-74).
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">R. D. Havens (208-09), and Paul Sherwin (386-89) also comment on the lack of action and the static, sculpturesque figures in <span class="titleAttribution">Hyperion</span>, contrasting these features to Milton’s more dynamic narrative.
                  </span></span> 
            Ultimately, Shears argues, Keats’s marginalia indicate that the Romantic poet read
            <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> as a “series of lyrical moments” rather than as a unified narrative poem (178; see also 159, 169), a tendency that casts doubt on the likelihood that he could have fulfilled his
            ambition of writing successful epic, narrative, or dramatic works.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Keats was not alone among his contemporaries, however, in his focus on detached, lyrical
            passages in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>.  Indeed, Shears claims that all the major Romantic poets read Milton’s epic in a
            similar “piecemeal” fashion (13), privileging evocative parts over the poem as a whole, especially its central argument
            that establishes a clear, determinate meaning to the characters and events it depicts.
            Among Keats’s circle of friends, one finds a similar emphasis on isolated descriptive
            passages, especially those depicting static, pictorial scenes.  William Hazlitt, in
            his lecture “On Shakespeare and Milton,” which Keats attended in January 1818 when he was beginning to read and annotate
            his copy of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, describes the central characters of the poem in terms that recall Keats’s note on
            Milton’s gift for “stationing or statu[a]ry”: “the persons of Adam and Eve, of Satan, &amp;c. are always accompanied, in our imagination,
            with the grandeur of the naked figure; they convey to us the ideas of sculpture.” After quoting <a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=112"><span class="titleAttribution">PL</span> 3.621-44</a>, Hazlitt concludes, “The figures introduced here have all the elegance and precision of a Greek statue” (5: 60). Similarly, in his <span class="titleAttribution">Round Table</span> essay on “Milton’s Eve” (a book Keats was reading with Benjamin Bailey in September 1817 [see <span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 166]), Hazlitt states that “The figures both of <span style="font-style:italic;">Adam</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Eve</span> are very prominent in this poem.  As there is little action in it, the interest is
            kept up by the beauty and grandeur of the images” (4: 106).  In “On Shakespeare and Milton,” Hazlitt seeks to dispel what he says is “a common perversity of criticism,” the belief that Milton’s “ideas were musical rather than picturesque.” Although Hazlitt agrees that Milton’s verse is “in the highest degree musical,” he asserts that it is also vividly pictorial. In fact, claims Hazlitt, “There is . . . the same depth of impression in his descriptions of the objects of
            all the different senses, whether colours, or sounds, or smells” (5: 59). Hazlitt’s criticism may have helped alert Keats to the striking visual and other
            sensory descriptive passages in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>. 
            
            <br><br>
            
            Leigh Hunt delighted in the pictorial elements of poetry and focused on detached scenes
            rather than continuous narrative or unifying ideas in his reading of long poems. 
            Hunt’s essay “A New Gallery of Pictures” declares that <span class="titleAttribution">The Faerie Queene</span> “contains a store of masterly, poetical pictures” (161), a claim Hunt supports by providing short quotations from the poem and naming
            an artist who would be appropriate for depicting the scene each describes. Greg Kucich
            argues that Hunt “taught Keats how to read <span class="titleAttribution">The Faerie Queene</span> as a gallery of discrete, gorgeous pictures. . . . instead of following his narratives” (<span class="titleAttribution">Keats, Shelley, and Romantic Spenserianism</span> 150), and Hunt no doubt approached <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> in a similar manner. R. Brimley Johnson claims that Hunt, like Matthew Arnold, practiced
            a form of literary criticism that involved selecting and commenting upon exemplary
            passages of poetry, rather than analyzing works as a whole (113). Hunt’s <span class="titleAttribution">Imagination and Fancy</span> (1844) follows this model, as it is composed of a series of extracts from various
            poets meant to illustrate the characteristic style and beauties of each, with selected
            lines and phrases in each extract italicized and then discussed in notes.  Hunt’s
            method in this anthology resembles that of marginalia, with the extracts corresponding
            to marked passages (perhaps scored with a vertical line), the italics reproducing
            the effect of underscoring, and the notes corresponding to marginal annotations. 
            In fact, Brimley Johnson believes that many of Hunt’s essays are “practically reproductions from some volume in his possession with his own underlinings
            and marginal notes transcribed” (113). For Hunt, marking and annotating selected passages in his books and discussing
            those same works in formal literary criticism were virtually synonymous activities.
            
            <br><br>
            
            In addition, Hunt’s own narrative poetry is full of detailed descriptions that often
            slow or impede the progression of the story.  Richard Cronin notes that the tendency
            in Hunt’s <span class="titleAttribution">The Story of Rimini</span> (1816) for “the narrative momentum to dissipate” as the poem lingers on descriptions of settings, costumes, animals, or incidental
            visual effects was one of the features of the poem that John Gibson Lockhart and other
            Tory reviewers castigated as a vulgar “Cockney” style.  What these reviewers objected
            to, Cronin states, was the way in which <span class="titleAttribution">Rimini</span> “refuses in its style that graceful subordination of part to whole, and of the less
            to the more important that secures the economy of classical narrative” (788). Clearly Keats was not alone among Romantic writers in his attention to passages
            of striking visual, auditory, tactile, and olfactory imagery in <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, often to the neglect of other passages such as characters’ speeches that advance
            the plot and develop its central argument.

            One can, however, challenge the claim of Shears and other critics that Keats’s focus
            on descriptive, lyrical passages reflects a misguided reading of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> that had detrimental consequences for his own work.  The rich imagery of Keats’s
            poetry, drawing on all the senses, even the “lower” ones of taste and smell, has long
            been considered one of its distinctive achievements, rather than a defect.  Many critics,
            moreover, argue that <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> does not in fact express a consistent argument and univocal meaning but is permeated
            with contradictions, ambiguities, and multiple perspectives that Keats and other Romantic
            writers recognized and built upon in their own works.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">The most influential advocate for this point of view is Lucy Newlyn.  For some other
                  recent versions of this argument see Henry Weinfield (1-9 and passim) and David Fairer (who includes discussion of Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia on 162-63).  Shears surveys numerous writers from the eighteenth century to the present (besides
                  the major Romantic poets) who argue that <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> is ambiguous and multi-vocal rather than consistent and determinate in its meaning
                  (see especially chapters 1, 2, and 9). 
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            In addition, <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> deviates from previous epics in ways that can be considered lyrical.  At the beginning
            of book 9, Milton famously distinguishes his choice of subject from those of other
            major epics, all of which center on war and battle (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=268">9.25-41</a>).  In <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, the climactic scene involves the decisions of Eve and Adam to eat a piece of fruit;
            the action is centered on the thoughts and feelings of the characters, rather than
            any dramatic deeds they perform.  Similarly, although the poem describes hell as a
            physical location, it presents Satan’s inner, psychological suffering as his most
            acute punishment, for as he states, “Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell” (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=121">4.75</a>). In <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span>, as in most lyric poetry, subjective states are more important than external actions.
            Moreover, in some passages Milton seemingly in his own voice speaks of his personal
            feelings and experiences, most notably at the beginning of book 3, where he laments
            his blindness and struggles to come to terms with this affliction (<a href="http://keatslibrary.org/paradise-lost/plviewer.php?pid=95">3.1-55</a>).  Carter Revard declares that in this passage “the impersonal epic has been transformed to personal lyric” (209), and he finds close parallels between Milton’s lines and Keats’s “Ode to a Nightingale.” Even if Keats and other Romantics went further than Milton in prioritizing short
            passages of lyrical description and self-expression over narrative, they followed
            a path that the Renaissance poet had embarked on before them.
            
            <br><br>
            
            A final qualification to the view that Keats’s marginalia reflect a selective, deficient
            reading of <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> is the fact that they highlight many other issues and aspects of the poem besides
            its vivid, evocative descriptions.  Among other motifs and effects Keats explores
            in his annotations and markings are an appreciation for the way in which obscurity
            and uncertainty stimulate the imagination; an interest in female decorum and solitude;
            a tension between the appeal of disciplined ambition and the pull of luxury and ease;
            a general fascination with contrasts; anti-monarchical sentiments; and a sensitivity
            to the pathos of change, suffering, and separation from loved ones and familiar surroundings.
            <span class="noteTooltip">(NOTE)<span class="noteTooltipText">For further discussion of these issues, see Lau 36-68.  Besides those already cited, others who analyze Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia include Ende 87-98; Williams 116-19; and Jackson 191-95.  Wittreich, Cook, and Wolfson provide some commentary on Keats’s notes in their
                  editions.  
                  </span></span> <br><br>
            
            These and other patterns and emphases that scholars may discover in Keats’s <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia yield valuable insights into Keats’s intertextual dialogue with one of
            his most important literary role models or “Presiders” (<span class="titleAttribution">Letters</span> 1: 142). The marginalia also provide evidence of reading practices and attitudes toward
            Milton characteristic of the period generally and of Keats’s coterie in particular.
            As Jackson says, “Marginalia . . . document the reader’s relation to the text.  They bring us about
            as close as we can reasonably expect ever to get to the reader’s processes of thought” (297).  Or, to adopt a phrase from Leigh Hunt, the <span class="titleAttribution">Paradise Lost</span> marginalia allow us to read Milton’s epic “<span style="font-style:italic;">on a principle of co-perusal</span>” with John Keats (<span class="titleAttribution">Imagination and Fancy</span> iii; Hunt’s emphasis).
