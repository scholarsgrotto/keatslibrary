          The first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject, Man's disobedience, and the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was placed: Then touches the prime cause of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the serpent; who, revolting from God, and drawing to his side many legions of Angels, was, by the command of God, driven out of Heaven with all his crew into the great deep. Which action passed over, the poem hastens into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now falling into Hell described here, not in the centre (for Heaven and Earth may be supposed not as yet made, certainly not yet accursed), but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest called Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunder-struck and astonished, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who next in order and dignity lay by him: they confer of their miserable fall; Satan awakens all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise, their numbers, array of battle, their chief leaders named, according to the idols known afterwards in Canaan and the countries adjoining. To these Satan directs his speech, comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new world and new kind of creature to be created, according to an ancient prophecy or report in Heaven; for that Angels were long before this visible creation, was the opinion of many Fathers. To find out the truth of this prophecy, and what to determine thereon, he refers to a full council. What his associates thence attempt.

         <p rend="italic">The consultation begun, Satan debates whether another battle be to be hazarded for the recovery of Heaven: Some advise it, others dissuade: A third proposal is preferred, mentioned before by Satan, to search the truth of that prophecy or tradition in Heaven concerning another world, and another kind of creature equal or not much inferior to themselves, about this time to be created. Their doubt who shall be sent on this difficult search; Satan their chief undertakes alone the voyage, is honoured and applauded. The council thus ended, the rest betake them several ways, and to several employments, as their inclinations lead them, to entertain the time till Satan return. He passes on his journey to Hell gates, finds them shut, and who sat there to guard them, by whom at length they are opened, and discover to him the great gulf between Hell and Heaven; with what difficulty he passes through, directed by Chaos, the Power of that place, to the sight of this new world which he sought.</p>

         <p rend="italic">God, sitting on his throne, sees Satan flying towards this world, then newly created; shews him to the Son who sat at his right hand; foretells the success of Satan in perverting mankind; clears his own justice and wisdom from all imputation, having created Man free, and able enough to have withstood his tempter; yet declares his purpose of grace towards him, in regard he fell not of his own malice, as did Satan, but by him seduced. The Son of God renders praises to his Father for the manifestation of his gracious purpose towards Man: but God again declares, that Grace cannot be extended towards Man without the satisfaction of divine justice: Man hath offended the majesty of God by aspiring to Godhead, and therefore, with all his progeny, devoted to death, must die, unless some one can be found sufficient to answer for his offence, and undergo his punishment. The Son of God freely offers himself a ransom for Man; the Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation, pronounces his exaltation above all names in Heaven and Earth; commands all the Angels to adore him; they obey, and hymning to their harps in full quire, celebrate the Father and the Son. Meanwhile Satan alights upon the bare convex of this world's outermost orb; where wandering he first finds a place, since called the Limbo of vanity; what persons and things fly up thither: thence comes to the gate of Heaven, described ascending by stairs, and the waters above the firmament that flow about it: His passage thence to the orb of the sun; he finds there Uriel the regent of that orb, but first changes himself into the shape of a meaner Angel: and pretending a zealous desire to behold the new creation, and Man whom God had placed here, inquires of him the place of his habitation, and is directed: alights first on mount Niphates.</p>

         <p rend="italic">SATAN, now in prospect of Eden, and nigh the place where he must now attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with himself, and many passions, fear, envy, and despair; but at length confirms himself in evil, journeys on to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described; overleaps the bounds; sits in the shape of a cormorant on the tree of life, as highest in the garden, to look about him. The garden described; Satan's first sight of Adam and Eve; his wonder at their excellent form and happy state, but with resolution to work their fall; overhears their discourse, thence gathers that the tree of knowledge was forbidden them to eat of, under penalty of death; and thereon intends to found his temptation, by seducing them to transgress: then leaves them awhile, to know further of their state by some other means. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sun-beam, warns Gabriel, who had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had escaped the deep, and passed at noon by his sphere, in the shape of a good Angel, down to Paradise, discovered after by his furious gestures in the mount. Gabriel promises to find him ere morning. Night coming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their rest: their bower described; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands of night-watch to walk the round of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to Adam's bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping: there they find him at the ear of Eve, tempting her in a dream, and bring him, though unwilling, to Gabriel; by whom questioned, he scornfully answers; prepares resistance; but, hindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise.</p>

         <l>Torment with ease, and soonest recompense</l>

         <l>To thee no reason, who knowst only good,</l>

         <p rend="italic">SATAN, now in prospect of Eden, and nigh the place where he must now attempt the bold enterprise which he undertook alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with himself, and many passions, fear, envy, and despair; but at length confirms himself in evil, journeys on to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described; overleaps the bounds; sits in the shape of a cormorant on the tree of life, as highest in the garden, to look about him. The garden described; Satan's first sight of Adam and Eve; his wonder at their excellent form and happy state, but with resolution to work their fall; overhears their discourse, thence gathers that the tree of knowledge was forbidden them to eat of, under penalty of death; and thereon intends to found his temptation, by seducing them to transgress: then leaves them awhile, to know further of their state by some other means. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sun-beam, warns Gabriel, who had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had escaped the deep, and passed at noon by his sphere, in the shape of a good Angel, down to Paradise, discovered after by his furious gestures in the mount. Gabriel promises to find him ere morning. Night coming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their rest: their bower described; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands of night-watch to walk the round of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to Adam's bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping: there they find him at the ear of Eve, tempting her in a dream, and bring him, though unwilling, to Gabriel; by whom questioned, he scornfully answers; prepares resistance; but, hindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise.</p>

         <l>Bad influence into the unwary breast</l>
         <l>Of his associate: He together calls,</l>
         <l>Or several one by one, the regent Powers,</l>
         <l>Under him regent; tells, as he was taught,</l>
         <l>That the Most High commanding, now ere night,</l>
         <l>Now ere dim night had disencumber'd Heaven,</l>
         <l>The great hierarchal standard was to move;</l>

         <l>In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,</l>
         <l>Nearly it now concerns us to be sure</l>
         <l>Of our omnipotence, and with what arms</l>
         <l>We mean to hold what anciently we claim</l>
         <l>Of deity or empire; such a foe</l>
         <l>Is rising, who intends to erect his throne</l>

         <l>In our defence, lest unawares we lose</l>

         <l>Made answer.  Mighty Father, thou thy foes</l>

         <l>Will ye submit your necks, and choose to bend</l>
         <l>The supple knee? Ye will not, if I trust</l>

         <l>Natives and sons of Heaven possess'd before</l>
         <l>By none; and if not equal all, yet free,</l>
         <l>Equally free; for orders and degrees</l>

         <l>Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn</l>
         <l>The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,</l>
         <l>That to his only Son by right endued</l>
         <l>With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven</l>
         <l>Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due</l>
         <l>Confess him rightful King? Unjust, thou sayst,</l>
         <l>Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,</l>
         <l>And equal over equals to let reign,</l>
         <l>One over all with unsucceeded power.</l>
         <l>Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute</l>

         <l>Thee what thou art, and form'd the Powers of Heaven</l>
         <l>Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?</l>
         <l>Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,</l>
         <l>And of our good and of our dignity</l>
         <l>How provident he is; how far from thought</l>
         <l>To make us less, bent rather to exalt</l>
         <l>Our happy state under one head more near</l>
         <l>United.  But to grant it thee unjust,</l>
         <l>That equal over equals monarch reign;</l>
         <l>Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,</l>
         <l>Or all angelic nature join'd in one,</l>
         <l>Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,</l>
         <l>As by his Word, the Mighty Father made</l>
         <l>All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven</l>
         <l>By him created in their bright degrees,</l>
         <l>Crown'd them with glory, and to their glory named</l>
         <l>Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,</l>
         <l>Essential Powers: nor by his reign obscured,</l>
         <l>But more illustrious made; since he the head</l>
         <l>One of our number thus reduced becomes;</l>
         <l>His laws our laws; all honour to him done</l>

         <l>The Apostate, and more haughty thus replied.</l>
         <l>That we were formed then sayst thou? and the work</l>

         <l>We know no time when we were not as now;</l>
         <l>Know none before us; self-begot, self-raised</l>
         <l>By our own quickening power, when fatal course</l>
         <l>Had circled his full orb, the birth mature</l>
         <l>Of this our native Heaven, etherial sons.</l>
         <l>Our puissance is our own, our own right hand</l>
         <l>Shall teach us highest deeds, by proof to try</l>
         <l>Who is our equal: Then thou shalt behold</l>
         <l>Whether by supplication we intend </l>
         <l>Address, and to begirt the almighty throne</l>
         <l>Beseeching or besieging.  This report,</l>

         <l>Unshaken, unseduced, unterrified,</l>

         <l>Nor number, nor example, with him wrought</l>
         <l>To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind,</l>
         <l>Though single.  From amidst them forth he pass'd,</l>
         <l>Long way through hostile scorn, which he sustain'd</l>
         <l>Superior, nor of violence feared aught;</l>
         <l>And with retorted scorn his back he turn'd</l>
         <l>On those proud towers to swift destruction doom'd.</l>

            <p rend="italic">RAPHAEL continues to relate how Michael and Gabriel were sent forth to battle against Satan and his Angels. The first fight described; Satan and his powers retire under night: He calls a council, invents devilish engines, which, in the second day's fight put Michael and his Angels to some disorder; but they at length, pulling up mountains, overwhelmed both the force and machines of Satan: yet the tumult not so ending, God on the third day sends Messiah, his Son, for whom he had reserved the glory of that victory: He, in the power of his Father, coming to the place, and causing all his legions to stand still on either side, with his chariot and thunder driving into the midst of his enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards the wall of Heaven; which opening, they leap down with horror and confusion into the place of punishment prepared for them in the deep: Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.</p>

            <l>To entertain them fair with open front</l>
            <l>And breast (what could we more) propounded terms</l>
            <l>Of composition, straight they changed their minds,</l>
            <l>Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,</l>
            <l>As they would dance; yet for a dance they seem'd</l>
            <l>Somewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps</l>
            <l>For joy of offer'd peace: But I suppose,</l>
            <l>If our proposals once again were heard,</l>
            <l>We should compel them to a quick result.</l>

            <l>Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,</l>

            <l>Such as we might perceive amused them all,</l>
            <l>And stumbled many: who receives them right,</l>

            <l>Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power</l>
            <l>Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!)</l>
            <l>Their arms away they threw, and to the hills</l>

            <l>Before him Power Divine his way prepared;</l>
            <l>At his command the uprooted hills retired</l>
            <l>Each to his place; they heard his voice, and went</l>
            <l>Obsequious; Heaven his wonted face renew'd,</l>

            <p rend="italic">SATAN, having compassed the Earth, with meditated guile returns, as a mist, by night into Paradise; enters into the serpent sleeping. Adam and Eve in the morning go forth to their labours, which Eve proposes to divide in several places, each labouring apart: Adam consents not, alleging the danger, lest that enemy, of whom they were forewarned, should attempt her found alone: Eve, loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough, urges her going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her strength; Adam at last yields: The Serpent finds her alone; his subtle approach, first gazing, then speaking; with much flattery extolling Eve above all other creatures. Eve, wondering to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he attained to human speech and such understanding not till now; the Serpent answers, that by tasting of a certain tree in the garden he attained to both speech and reason, till then void of both: Eve requires him to bring her to that tree, and finds it to be the tree of knowledge forbidden: The Serpent, now grown bolder, with many wiles and arguments, induces her at length to eat; she, pleased with the taste, deliberates awhile whether to impart thereof to Adam or not; at last brings him of the fruit; relates what persuaded her to eat thereof: Adam, at first amazed, but perceiving her lost, resolves, through vehemence of love, to perish with her; and, extenuating the trespass, eats also of the fruit: The effects thereof in them both: they seek to cover their nakedness; then fall to variance and accusation of another.</p>

            <l>What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obey'd:</l>
            <l>I was at first as other beasts that graze </l>

            <p rend="italic">MAN'S transgression known, the guardian Angels forsake Paradise, and return up to Heaven to approve their vigilance, and are approved; God declaring that the entrance of Satan could not be by them prevented. He sends his Son to judge the transgressors; who descends, and gives sentence accordingly; then in pity clothes them both, and re-ascends. Sin and Death sitting till then at the gates of Hell, by wonderous sympathy feeling the success of Satan in this new world, and the sin by Man there committed, resolve to sit no longer confined in Hell, but to follow Satan their sire up to the place of Man: To make the way easier from Hell to this world to and fro, they pave a broad highway, or bridge over Choas[sic], according to the tract that Satan first made; then preparing for Earth, they meet him, proud of his success, returning to Hell; their mutual gratulation. Satan arrives at Pandemonium, in full assembly relates with boasting his success against Man; instead of applause is entertained with a general hiss by all his audience, transformed with himself also suddenly into serpents, according to his doom given in Paradise; then, deluded with a shew of the forbidden tree springing up before them, they, greedily reaching to take of the fruit, chew dust and bitter ashes. The proceedings of Sin and Death: God foretells the final victory of his Son over them, and the renewing of all things; but, for the present, commands his Angels to make several alterations in the heavens and elements. Adam, more and more perceiving his fallen condition, heavily bewails, rejects the condolement of Eve; she persists, and at length appeases him: then, to evade the curse likely to fall on their offspring, proposes to Adam violent ways, which he approves not; but, conceiving better hope, puts her in mind of the late promise made them, that her seed should be revenged on the Serpent; and exhorts her with him to seek peace of the offended Deity, by repentance and supplication.</p>

            <l>The angelic guards ascended, mute, and sad, </l>

            <l>Mine, both in Heaven and Earth, to do thy will</l>
            <l>Supreme; that thou in me, thy Son beloved, </l>
            <l>Mayst ever rest well pleased. I go to judge </l>
            <l>On earth these thy transgressors; but thou knows, </l>
            <l>Whoever judged, the worst on me must light, </l>
            <l>When time shall be, for so I undertook</l>
            <l>Before thee; and, not repenting, this obtain </l>

            <l>On me derived, yet I shall temper so</l>
            <l>Justice with mercy, as may illustrate most</l>
            <l>Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. </l>
            <l>Attendance none shall need, nor train, where none</l>
            <l>Are to behold the judgment, but the judged, </l>
            <l>Those two; the third best absent is condemn'd, </l>
            <l>Convict by flight, and rebel to all law:</l>

            <l>Love was not in their looks, either to God, </l>

            <l>Anger and obstinacy, and hate, and guile. </l>

            <l>Lest that pure breath of life, the spirit of Man</l>

            <l>With this corporeal clod; then, in the grave, </l>
            <l>Or in some other dismal place, who knows</l>
            <l>But I shall die a living death? O thought</l>
            <l>Horrid, if true! yet, why? it was but breath</l>
            <l>Of life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life</l>
            <l>And sin? the body properly hath neither.</l>
            <l>All of me then shall die: let this appease </l>
            <l>The doubt, since human reach no further knows. </l>
            <l>For though the Lord of all be infinite, </l>
            <l>Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so, </l>
            <l>But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise </l>
            <l>Wrath without end on Man whom death must end? </l>
            <l>Can he make deathless death? That were to make </l>
            <l>Strange contradiction, which to God himself </l>
            <l>Impossible is held, as argument</l>
            <l>Of weakness, not of power.  Will he draw out,</l>
            <l>For anger's sake, finite to infinite,</l>
            <l>In punish'd Man, to satisfy his rigour,</l>
            <l>Satisfied never? That were to extend </l>
            <l>His sentence beyond dust and Nature's law; </l>
            <l>By which all causes else, according still </l>

            <l>Bereaving sense, but endless misery</l>

            <p rend="italic">THE Son of God presents to his Father, the prayers of our first parents now repenting, and intercedes for them: God accepts them, but declares that they must no longer abide in Paradise; sends Michael with a band of Cherubim to dispossess them; but first to reveal to Adam future things: Michael's coming down. Adam shews to Eve certain ominous signs; he discerns Michael's approach: goes out to meet him: the Angel denounces their departure. Eve's lamentation. Adam pleads, but submits: The Angel leads him up to a high hill; sets before him in vision what shall happen till the flood.</p>

            <p rend="italic">THE Angel Michael continues, from the flood, to relate what shall succeed; then, in the mention of Abraham, comes by degrees to explain, who that Seed of the Woman shall be, which was promised Adam and Eve in the Fall; his incarnation, death, resurrection, and ascension: the state of the church till his second coming. Adam, greatly satisfied and recomforted by these relations and promises, descends the hill with Michael: wakens Eve, who all this while had slept, but with gentle dreams composed to quietness of mind and submission. Michael in either hand leads them out of Paradise, the fiery sword waving behind them, and the Cherubim taking their stations to guard the place.</p>

            <l>As one who in his journey bates at noon, </l>
            <l>Though bent on speed; so here the Arch-Angel paused</l>
            <l>Betwixt the world destroy'd and world restored,</l>
            <l>If Adam aught perhaps might interpose;</l>

            <l>   Thus hast thou seen one world begin, and end;</l>
            <l>And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.</l>
            <l>Much hast thou yet to see; but I perceive</l>
            <l>Thy mortal sight to fail; objects divine</l>

            <l>The river dragon tamed at length submits</l>
            <l>To let his sojourners depart, and oft</l>
            <l>Humbles his stubborn heart; but still, as ice</l>
            <l>More harden'd after thaw; till, in his rage</l>
            <l>Pursuing whom he late dismiss'd, the sea</l>
            <l>Swallows him with his host; but them lets pass,</l>

            <l>Aw'd by the rod of Moses so to stand</l>

            <l>Then, through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,</l>

            <l>In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets sound,</l>

            <l>This yet I apprehend not, why to those </l>
            <l>Among whom God will deign to dwell on Earth,</l>
            <l>So many and so various laws are given;</l>
            <l>So many laws argue so many sins</l>

            <l>Will reign among them, as of thee begot;</l>
            <l>And therefore was law given them, to evince</l>
            <l>Their natural pravity, by stirring up</l>
            <l>Sin against law to fight: that when they see</l>
            <l>Law can discover sin, but not remove,</l>
            <l>Save by those shadowy expiations weak,</l>
            <l>The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude</l>
            <l>Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;</l>
            <l>Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness,</l>
            <l>To them by faith imputed, they may find</l>
            <l>Justification towards God, and peace</l>
            <l>Of conscience, which the law by ceremonies</l>
            <l>Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part </l>
            <l>Perform, and not performing cannot live.</l>
            <l>So law appears imperfect, and but given </l>
            <l>With purpose to resign them, in full time,</l>
            <l>Up to a better covenant, disciplined</l>
            <l>From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;</l>

            <l>In sin for ever lost from life; this act</l>
            <l>Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,</l>
            <l>Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms;</l>
            <l>And fix far deeper in his head their stings</l>
            <l>Than temporal death shall bruise the victor's heel,</l>
            <l>Or theirs whom he redeems; a death, like sleep,</l>
            <l>A gentle wafting to immortal life.</l>
            <l>Nor after resurrection shall he stay </l>
            <l>Longer on earth, than certain times to appear</l>
            <l>To his disciples, men who in his life</l>

            <l>To teach all nations what of him they learn'd</l>
            <l>And his salvation; them who shall believe</l>
            <l>Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign</l>
            <l>Of washing them from guilt of sin to life</l>
            <l>Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,</l>
            <l>For death, like that which the Redeemer died.</l>
            <l>All nations they shall teach; for, from that day,</l>
            <l>Not only to the sons of Abraham's loins</l>
            <l>Salvation shall be preach'd, but to the sons</l>

            <l>So in his seed all nations shall be bless'd.</l>
            <l>Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend</l>
            <l>With victory, triumphing through the air</l>
            <l>Over his foes and thine. There shall surprise</l>
            <l>The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains</l>

            <l>Then enter into glory, and resume </l>
            <l>His seat at God's right hand, exalted high</l>

            <l>His faithful, and receive them into bliss,</l>

            <l>   So spake the Arch-Angel Michael; then paused,</l>
            <l>As at the world's great period; and our Sire</l>
            <l>Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.</l>
            
         </lg><lg>
            
            <l>  O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!</l>
            <l>That all this good of evil shall produce,</l>
            <l>And evil turn to good; more wonderful</l>
            <l>Than that which by creation first brought forth</l>
            <l>Light out of darkness! Full of doubt I stand,</l>
            <l>Whether I should repent me now of sin</l>
            <l>By me done, and occasion'd; or rejoice</l>
            <l>Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;</l>
            <l>To God more glory, more good-will to Men</l>
            <l>From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.</l>
            <l>But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven</l>
            <l>Must reascend, what will betide the few,</l>
            <l>His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,</l>
            <l>The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide </l>
            <l>His people, who defend? Will they not deal</l>
            <l>Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?</l>
            
         </lg><lg>
            
            <l>   Besure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven</l>
            <l>He to his own a Comforter will send,</l>
            <l>The promise of the Father, who shall dwell</l>
            <l>His Spirit within them; and the law of faith,</l>
            <l>Working through love, upon their hearts shall write,</l>
            <l>To guide them in all truth; and also arm</l>

            <l>With spiritual armour, able to resist</l>
            <l>Satan's assaults, and quench his fiery darts;</l>
            <l>What man can do against them, not afraid</l>
            <l>Though to the death; against such cruelties</l>
            <l>With inward consolations recompensed,</l>
            <l>And oft supported so as shall amaze</l>
            <l>Their proudest persecutors: For the Spirit</l>
            <l>Pour'd first on his Apostles, whom he sends</l>
            <l>To evangelize the nations, then on all</l>
            <l>Baptized, shall them with wonderous gifts endue</l>
            <l>To speak all tongues, and do all miracles,</l>
            <l>As did their Lord before them. Thus they win</l>
            <l>Great numbers of each nation to receive</l>
            <l>With joy the tidings brought from Heaven: At length</l>
            <l>Their ministry perform'd, and race well run,</l>
            <l>Their doctrine and their story written left,</l>
            <l>They die; but in their room, as they forewarn,</l>
            <l>Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous wolves,</l>
            <l>Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven</l>
            <l>To their own vile advantages shall turn</l>
            <l>Of lucre and ambition; and the truth</l>
            <l>With superstitions and traditions taint,</l>
            <l>Left only in those written records pure,</l>
            <l>Though not but by the Spirit understood.</l>
            <l>Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,</l>
            <l>Places, and titles, and with these to join</l>
            <l>Secular power; though feigning still to act</l>
            <l>By spiritual, to themselves appropriating</l>
            <l>The Spirit of God, promised alike and given</l>
            <l>To all believers; and, from that pretence,</l>
            <l>Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force</l>
            <l>On every conscience; laws which none shall find</l>
            <l>Left them enroll'd, or what the Spirit within</l>
            <l>Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then</l>

            <l>Measured this transient world, the race of time, </l>
            <l>Till time stand fix'd! Beyond is all abyss,</l>

            <l>Greatly in peace of thought; and have my fill</l>
            <l>Of knowledge, what this vessel can contain;</l>
            <l>Beyond which was my folly to aspire.</l>
            <l>Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best,</l>

            <l>As in his presence; ever to observe</l>

            <l>Merciful over all his works, with good</l>

         </lg><lg>
            
            <l>   When thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know;</l>
            <l>For God is also in sleep, and dreams advise,</l>
            <l>Which he hath sent propitious, some great good</l>
            <l>Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress</l>
            <l>Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;</l>
            <l>In me is no delay; with thee to go</l>
            <l>Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,</l>

            <l>Who for my wilful crime art banish'd hence.</l>
            <l>This further consolation yet secure</l>

         See an article by me signed “an admirer of Keats”—in the Athenaeum—Oct 26th 1872.  I discovered that J. F. C. was the Revd James Freeman Clarke[.]  I discovered that Herbert Lindon (son of Louis Lindon who died after the article was written) had Keats’ Shakespeare—with the original draft of the sonnet “on sitting down to read King Lear once again” &amp; the lines “on seeing a lock of Milton’s hair”.

      This note was written by Sir Charles Dilke, grandson of Charles Wentworth and Maria Dilke, to the latter of whom Keats gave his copy of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>.  In his note, Sir Charles Dilke refers to an article he published in <title rend="italic">The Athenaeum</title> under the name “An Admirer of Keats,” in which he transcribed the eight notes in Keats’s <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> that had not been previously published by “J. F. C.” or James Freeman Clarke in the American periodical <title rend="italic">The Dial</title> for April 1843 (see discussion in Introduction, section on “Transmission and Publication History”).  Herbert Lindon was the son of Louis and Fanny Brawne Lindon.  Keats gave his folio copy of <title rend="italic">Mr. William Shakespeare’s Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies</title>, into which he written the two poems Dilke mentions, to Fanny Brawne before he left for Italy.

         The Genius of Milton, more particularly in respect to its span in immensity, calculated him, by a sort of birthright, for such an 'argument' as the paradise lost. he had an exquisite passion for what is properly in the sense of ease and pleasure poetical Luxury&mdash;and with that it appears to me he would fain have been content if he could so doing have preserved his self respect and feel of duty perform'd&mdash;but there was working in him as it were that same sort of thing as operates in the great world to the end of a Prophecy's being accomplish'd&mdash;therefore he devoted himself rather to the Ardours than the pleasures of Song, solacing himself at intervals with cups of old wine&mdash;and those are with some exceptions the finest parts of the Poem. <del>In some par</del> With some exceptions&mdash;for the spirit of mounting and adventure can never be unfruitful or unrewarded&mdash;had he not broken through the clouds which envellope so deliciously the Elysian field of Verse and committed himself to the Extreme we never should have seen Satan as described

         Keats’s characterization of Milton’s conflict between “poetical Luxury” and “the Ardours . . . of Song” resembles his own struggle with these impulses, as when he distinguishes between a “Life of Sensations” and a life of “Thoughts” in a 22 November 1817 letter to Bailey and when he tells John Taylor on 24 April 1818 that “I have been hovering for some time between an exquisite sense of the luxurious and a love for Philosophy” (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 185, 271).  Some critics, in fact, believe that Keats in this note is projecting onto Milton his own inner conflicts (Wilkie 162; Trott, “Keats and the Prison-House” 270).  Others, however, note that choices between sensuality and other temptations of this world versus disciplined obedience are central to Milton’s poetry, from “L’Allegro” and “Il Penseroso” to <title rend="italic">Comus</title>, <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, <title rend="italic">Samson Agonistes</title>, and <title rend="italic">Paradise Regained</title>, so that Keats may be identifying a struggle he shares with the elder poet (see especially Leslie Brisman ix-54).  Newlyn claims that “It is to moments of choice” in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> “that the Romantics frequently return, especially in their narrative poetry” (85).  Havens notes both similarities and differences between Keats and Milton regarding the conflict between duty and “poetical Luxury” (213-14).

         There is a greatness which the Paradise Lost possesses over every other Poem&mdash;<emph rend="su">the Magnitude of Contrast</emph> and that is softened by the contrast being ungrotesque to a degree&mdash;Heaven moves on like music throughout&mdash;Hell is also peopled with angels it also move[s] on like music not grating and ha[r]sh but like a grand accompaniment in the Base to Heaven&mdash;

         “Hell is also peopled with angels it also move[s] on like music not grating and ha[r]sh” is an allusion to Wordsworth’s “Lines Composed a Few Miles above Tintern Abbey,” 91-92: “The still, sad music of humanity, / Nor harsh nor grating.”
         
         <p>Several other of Keats’s notes convey an appreciation of contrasts in Milton.  The <ref target="#kpl1.18">note on PL 1.535-69</ref> celebrates the “light and shade—the sort of black brightness” in that passage.  The <ref target="#kpl1.62">note at the beginning of book 3</ref> praises Milton’s “management” of the poem as the setting shifts from hell to heaven and declares, “we are getting ripe for diversity.”  Finally, the related terms “sublime pathetic” and “Grandeur of Tenderness” in notes on <ref target="#kpl1.44">2.546-52</ref> and <ref target="#kpl1.85">4.1-4</ref>, respectively, are oxymoronic and thereby signify a blending of contrasting qualities.  Keats’s appreciation of opposites in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> is further expressed in the poem “Welcome joy, and welcome sorrow,” which has for a motto “Under the flag / Of each his faction, they to battle bring / Their embryo atoms,” a slight misquotation from <ref target="#kpl1.054.0899l">PL 2.899-901</ref>.  Keats also responds to passages that convey not the delight and harmony but the pain of contrast, as when he underscores and marks with triple vertical lines Satan’s experience of “the hateful siege / Of contraries” (<ref target="#kpl2.078.0121l">9.121-22</ref>).  Keats also quotes this passage to describe the conflict he feels composing Hyperion while his brother is dying (Letters 1: 369).  R. S. White notes that Keats’s markings in his two copies of Shakespeare’s plays often draw attention to contrasts and oppositions (24-25).  For further discussion of Keats’s interest in contrasts in Paradise Lost see Lau 59-61; Fairer 162-63.</p>

         Compare Keats’s remark in his 4 January 1818 <title rend="italic">Champion</title> review of <title rend="italic">Retribution, or the Chieftain’s Daughter</title> (written around the same time as Keats was beginning to read and annotate his copy of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>): <q>“The title of an old play gives us a direct taste and surmise of its inwards, as the first lines of the Paradise Lost smack of the great Poem”</q> (Forman 5: 247).  Apropos of Keats’s reference to the <q>“charm”</q> of the opening of <q>“Dante’s Hell,”</q> Robert Gittings notes that <q>“the first two pages of the first canto of the <title rend="italic">Inferno</title> [are marked] more heavily than anywhere else”</q> in Keats’s copy (10).

         One of the most mysterious of semi-speculations is, one would suppose, that of one Mind's imagining into another Things may be described by a Man's self in parts so as to make a grand whole which that Man him-self would scarcely inform to its excess. A Poet can seldom have justice done to his imagination&mdash;for men are as distinct in their conceptions of material shadowings as they are in matters of spiritual understanding&mdash;it can scarcely be conceived how Milton's Blindness might here ade the magnitude of his conceptions as a bat in a large gothic vault&mdash;.

         <p>Several critics compare Keats's marginal remarks on this page to his concept of Negative Capability, as expressed in his 27 (?) December 1817 letter to his brothers (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 193-94).  See Finney 1: 340, Wittreich 564n19, Williams 117.</p>
         
         <p>Compare Keats’s emphasis on the uniqueness of each poet’s imagination (<q>"men are as distinct in their conceptions of material shadowings as they are in matters of spiritual understanding"</q>) to his remarks on Milton’s originality in <ref target="#kpl1.92">his note to page 91 of volume 1 (<title rend="italic">PL</title> book 4) </ref>. </p>
         
         <p>By “ade” Keats presumably means “aid.”</p>
         
         <p>Keats suggests that Milton’s blindness enhanced his creativity by liberating his imagination over actual, visual perception. In the same way Keats lauds Homer’s <q>“triple sight in blindness keen”</q> in his 1818 sonnet <title>“To Homer”</title> and writes <q>“Milton”</q> beside a passage in <title rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</title> that describes a holy man who is blind in <q>“earthly Eyen,”</q> but whose spirit is <q>“wondrous quick and pierceant . . . As Eagle’s Eye, that can behold the Sun”</q> (book 1, canto 10, stanza 47; see Lowell 2: 570).  Similarly, in <title rend="italic">The Fall of Hyperion</title> Moneta’s eyes are <q>“Half closed, and visionless entire they seem’d / Of all external things”</q> (1.267-68), though the goddess possesses the wisdom of the ages and bestows on the speaker <q>“A power within me of enormous ken, / To see as a God sees”</q> (1.303-04).  One can also compare the passage in <title>“Ode to a Nightingale”</title> in which the speaker is impelled to <q>“guess each sweet”</q> by means of his imagination when he can no longer <q>“see what flowers are at my feet”</q> (43, 41).  Interestingly, however, Keats does not mark <ref target="#kpl1.062.0051l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 3.51-55,</ref> where Milton claims that his blindness is compensated for by a <q>“celestial light”</q> that <q>“shine[s] inward” and “plant[s] eyes”</q> in his mind so that he <q>“may see and tell / Of things invisible to mortal sight.”</q> Perhaps Keats was unsympathetic with the explicitly religious nature of the inspiration Milton invokes in this passage.  For a discussion of <ref target="#kpl1.062.0051l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 3.51-55</ref> in relation to <title>“Ode to a Nightingale,”</title> see Revard (211-14).

         There is a cool pleasure in the very sound of vale&mdash;The english word is of the happiest chance. Milton has put vales in heaven and hell with the very utter affection and yearning of a great Poet. It is a sort of delphic Abstraction a beautiful thing made more beautiful by being reflected and put in a Mist. The Next mention of Vale is one of the most pathetic in the whole range of Poetry <q source="#kpl1.044.0546l">'Others more mild, retreated in a Silent Valley'</q>&amp;[c]. How much of the charm is in the Valley!&mdash;

         <p>Keats marks several passages in <title rend="italic">PL</title> in which mist is mentioned (<ref target="#kpl1.019.0594l">1.594-96</ref>; <ref target="#kpl1.122.0185l">5.185-87</ref>).  In addition, two passages that describe light veiled by a cloud are underscored (<ref target="#kpl1.071.0377l">3.377-82</ref>; <ref target="#kpl2.041.0360l">7.360</ref>).  Keats’s marginal remark here on things made more beautiful by being <q>“put in a Mist”</q> may be compared to <ref target="#kpl1.23">his note on page 23 of volume 1 (<title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> book 1)</ref>, in which he celebrates <q>“the intense pleasure of not knowing”</q> that produces <q>“A sense of independence, of power from the fancy’s creating a world of its own by the sense of probabilities,”</q> as well as his note on <ref target="#kpl1.5">page 5 of volume 1</ref>, where Milton’s blindness is said to have aided “<q>the magnitude of his conceptions as a bat in a large gothic vault.”</q> These various comments are in keeping with the aesthetic of the sublime, according to which obscure images are more powerful and moving than clear images and indistinct or ambiguous ideas are more stimulating than definite ones.  Milton was a touchstone of the sublime for many Romantic writers (see Newlyn 11-12, 49-62, 193-204; Trott, <title>“Milton and the Romantics”</title> 530-32. See also the section on “Obscurity” in Lau 49-54). Leigh Hunt published an essay on <title>“Mists and Fogs”</title> in <title rend="italic">The Indicator</title>, 1 December 1819, in which he cites numerous instances from literature (including <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>) of appearances made more impressive by atmospheric haze.  Keats celebrates Fall as the <q>“Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness”</q> in <title>“To Autumn”</title> (1), a passage that may be indebted to <ref target="#kpl1.122.0185l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 5.185-87</ref>.</p>
         <p>Wolfson notes that <q>“Apollo’s oracular communications at Delphi often involved mist; Delphic thus means ‘obscure’”</q> (227n4).  Delphi’s association with Apollo, god of poetry, also suggests that “Delphic” means “inspired.”  Keats uses the word again in his note to <ref target="#kpl1.85"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 4.1-4</ref> (“Nothing can be higher—Nothing so more than delphic”).</p> 
         <p>Wilkie relates Keats's note on <q>"charm [...] in the Valley"</q> to the shady vale in which <title rend="italic">Hyperion</title> opens and to Keats’s 21 April 1819 “vale of Soul-making” letter.  <q>“All three of these references to ‘vale,’”</q> Wilkie writes, <q>“express the same theme: the transition from a world of innocence or joy or both to a world of tragic suffering”</q> (165).  Jonathan Bate discusses Keats’s note on vales as it reflects differences between Keats’s and Milton’s treatments of fallen and unfallen conditions (“Keats’s Two Hyperions” 322-24).

         <p>"Perplexes monarchs" (line 599): like many progressive Romantic writers, Keats frequently celebrates Milton as a patriot who opposed monarchical tyranny.  For example, in <title>“Oh! How I love, on a fair summer’s eve”</title> Keats writes, <q>“There warm my breast with patriotic lore, / Musing on Milton’s fate—on Sydney’s bier”</q> (9-10), and in a letter to George and Georgiana he similarly remarks, <q>“there are none [at the current time] prepared to suffer in obscurity for their Country. . . . We have no Milton, no Algernon Sidney”</q> (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 396; see also 397).  For Milton’s reputation in the Romantic period as a defender of liberty who suffered heroically for his views, see Newlyn 32-39; on Keats’s association of Milton with liberal politics, see Roe 28, 47, 49, 209.  Wolfson suggests that the reference to <q>“the blasted heath”</q> in line 615, a little further down from the lines that provoked his note praising Milton’s <q>“noble and collected . . . indignation against Kings,”</q> may have reminded Keats of King Lear, <q>“exiled to the blasted heath, where he confronts his pompous neglect of his poor subjects”</q> (Wolfson 229n6).  The phrase may also have suggested to Keats the setting where another tragic, misguided Shakespearean figure—Macbeth—hears the prophecy of the three witches that impels him on his bloodthirsty pursuit of a throne.

         <p>Jackson observes that Keats’s use of “We” instead of “I” in this and other notes (those on <ref target="#kpl1.44">pages 44-45 of volume 1 [book 2]</ref> and <ref target="#kpl1.62">pages 62-63 [book 3]</ref>) suggests the communal nature of his marginalia.

On Keats’s expectation of an audience for his marginalia, see also Lau 13-16.  </p>
         <p>Wolfson perceives a <q>“rich layering of meanings”</q> in Keats’s phrase, <q>“we imagine after them”</q> (the <q>“Romances lost”</q>) and offers three implications: <q>“our imagination is chronologically later; strains to grasp them; takes their pattern”</q> (231n11).</p>

         Milton is godlike in the sublime pathetic. In Demons, fallen Angels, and Monsters the delicacies of passion living in and from their immortality, is of the most softening and dissolving nature. It is carried to the utmost here&mdash;<q>Others more mild</q>&mdash;nothing can express the sensation one feels at '<q rend="su">Their song was partial</q> &amp;[c]. Examples of this nature are divine to the utmost in other poets&mdash;in Caliban '<q rend="su">Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</q>' &amp;c[.] In Theocritus'&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Polyphemus&mdash;and Homers Hymn to Pan where Mercury is represented as taking his '<q rend="su">homely fac'd</q>' to heaven. There are numerous other instances in Milton&mdash;where Satan's progeny is called his '<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl1.052.0817l">daughter dear</q></emph>,' and where this same Sin, a female, and with a feminine instinct for the showy &amp; martial is in pain lest death should sully his bright arms '<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl1.051.0811l">nor vainly hope to be invulnerable in those bright arms</q></emph>'.

         <p>In his lecture <title>“On Shakespeare and Milton”</title> Hazlitt writes that “of all the passages in Paradise Lost, the description of the employments of the angels during the absence of Satan, some of whom ‘retreated in a silent valley, sing with notes angelical to many a harp their own heroic deeds and hapless fall by doom of battle,’ is the most perfect example of mingled pathos and sublimity” (5: 66).  The passage Hazlitt cites, <ref target="#kpl1.044.0546l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 2.546-50</ref>, is not only marked by Keats (with underscoring and a marginal line) but is also quoted in his note on <ref target="#kpl1.012.0321l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 1.321</ref>.  Other passages in which Hazlitt juxtaposes the terms <q>“sublimity”</q> and <q>“pathos”</q> occur in his lecture <title>“On Poetry in General”</title> (5: 5) and his edition of <title rend="italic">Select British Poets</title> (9: 237 [on Milton], 241-42 [on Thomas Gray], and 244 [on Byron]).  Stuart Ende believes that Hazlitt, “As well as being the probable source of Keats’s ‘sublime pathetic’ . . . may have provided Keats with his understanding of both sublimity and pathos” (190n21).  Ende discusses at length Keats’s concept of the “sublime pathetic” (xvi-xvii, 27-28, 89-91, 96-97).  See also Albrecht (who disagrees with Ende) 198-201 and Lau 61-66.</p>
         
         <p>In his note Keats quotes from Shakespeare’s <title rend="italic">The Tempest</title> 3.2.134 and George Chapman’s translation of Homer’s <title rend="italic">Hymn to Pan</title>, line 74.  Keats’s pronoun in the phrase “his homely fac’d to heaven” is ambiguous; in <title rend="italic">Hymn to Pan</title>, the passage refers to Pan’s face.  Theocritus recounts Polyphemus’s unrequited love for Galatea in his eleventh idyll.
         </p>
         
         <p>It is interesting to compare the passage not underscored in lines 254-255 (<q>“and took with ravishment / The thronging audience”</q>) to a comment Keats made about a similar passage in book 4 of Wordsworth’s <title rend="italic">Excursion</title>.  According to Benjamin Bailey, Keats said that the line <q>“And filled the illumined groves with ravishment”</q> (<title rend="italic">The Excursion</title> 4.860) should have been omitted from Wordsworth’s description of Apollo (<title rend="italic">Keats Circle</title> 2: 276).  Keats himself uses <q>“ravishment”</q> in <title>“I stood tip-toe upon a little hill”</title> 147 and <title rend="italic">Endymion</title> 2.715, 875, so he does not appear to have found this word objectionable in itself.

         Apollo’s attributes as god of the sun and of poetry are both relevant to this note of Keats's, which praises Milton’s magisterial handling of his epic poem as it moves from hell into the precincts of light and heaven in book 3.  Adjectives similar to <q>“Apollonian”</q> that express Keats’s admiration for Milton’s achievement in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> are <q>“godlike”</q> in his note to <ref target="#kpl1.44"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 2.546-52</ref> (<q>“Milton is godlike in the sublime pathetic”</q>) and <q>“delphic”</q> in <ref target="#kpl1.85">his note to PL 4.1-4</ref> (<q>“nothing can be higher—Nothing so more than delphic”</q>).  See also <q>“Delphic Abstraction”</q> in <ref target="#kpl1.12">his note to <title rend="italic">PL</title> 1.321</ref>.

         On line 71, Keats draws an exclamation point after <q>“sight,”</q> probably to challenge the word’s validity.  In most editions of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>, the word is given as <q>“side.”</q>  The marginalia in Keats’s two editions of Shakespeare’s plays and in Z. Jackson’s <title rend="italic">Shakspeare’s Genius Justified</title> frequently question the editors’ construction of a line or passage. See Forman 5: 268-75, 287-90 and the discussion in Jackson 190-93.

         <p>Benjamin Bailey told Richard Monckton Milnes in 1849 that this note about “a friend of mine” referred to himself, for <q>“We had much talk of Milton when Keats was at Oxford: &amp; I remember that I expressed, though more at large, this opinion, or something to the effect here noted down”</q> (<title rend="italic">Keats Circle</title> 2: 296).  The “friend” mentioned in Keats’s note may actually be Charles Wentworth Dilke rather than Bailey.  A copy of Milton’s poems bearing Dilke’s bookplate (owned by Keats House) contains an annotation at the beginning of book 4 of <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> that is similar to Keats’s: <q>“The opening of this Book is fearful[ly] sublime.—It gives note of dreadful preparation.—It seems to rouse us from a moral slumber, &amp; bids us prepare for some strange &amp; unkn[own] consequences—It is fit prelude to the act:--an act that in its consequen[ce] was to be felt through all succeeding generations.  It is much the finest in the whole work.”</q>  Claude Lee Finney points out the similarity between Dilke’s and Keats’s remarks on the opening of book 4 and believes the two men were reading and discussing <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> in December 1817 and January 1818 (1: 337).  Both Bailey and Dilke may have influenced Keats’s response to the beginning of book 4 as expressed in this note.</p>
         
         <p>
            The phrase <q>“Grandeur of Tenderness”</q> is similar to <q>“sublime pathetic,”</q> which Keats uses in <ref target="#kpl1.44">his note on pages 44 and 45 of volume 1</ref>.  Compare also <ref target="#kpl1.092.0271l">his note on the pathos of <title rend="italic">PL</title> 4.271-72</ref>.

            Apollo was believed to communicate with petitioners at his oracle at Delphi.  <q>“Delphic”</q> therefore means divinely inspired, though for Keats the divinity in question is the Greek god of poetry (and the sun) rather than Milton’s Christian muse Urania (see <ref target="#kpl1.3"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 1.6-12</ref>, <ref target="#kpl2.31">7.1-39</ref>).  Keats concludes each stanza of his poem <title>“God of the golden bow”</title> with the phrase, <q>“O Delphic Apollo.”</q>  His poem <title>“On Receiving a Laurel Crown from Leigh Hunt,”</title> written around the same time as <title>“God of the golden bow”</title> (late 1816 / early 1817) laments his lack of inspiration by stating, <q>“Minutes are flying swiftly; and as yet / Nothing unearthly has enticed my brain / Into a delphic labyrinth”</q> (1-3).  For other uses of “Delphic” or “Apollonian” in the <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> marginalia, see <ref target="#kpl1.62 #kpl1.63">editorial note to volume 1, pages 62-63</ref>.

         There are two specimens of a very extraordinary beauty in the Paradise Lost, they are of a nature as far as I have read, unexampled elsewhere&mdash;they are entirely distinct from the brief pathos of Dante&mdash;and they are not to be found even in Shakspeare&mdash;they are according to the great prerogative of poetry better described in themselves than by a volume the one is in this fol. '<emph rend="su"><q>which cost Ceres all that pain</q></emph>'&mdash;the other is that ending '<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl2.032.0037l">Nor could the Muse defend her son</q></emph>'&mdash;they appear exclusively Miltonic without the shadow of another mind ancient or modern&mdash;

         <p>Keats slightly misquotes line 239 in a 27 June 1818 letter to Tom Keats: <q>“the stream itself is interesting throughout with <q>‘mazy error over pendant shades.’</q>  Milton meant a smooth river—this is buffetting all the way on a rocky bed ever various”</q> (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 300).</p>
         
         <p>The two passages Keats singles out in his marginal note as examples <q>“of a very extraordinary beauty in the Paradise Lost”</q>—Ceres’s loss of her daughter Proserpine to the god Pluto or Dis and the muse Calliope’s inability to save her son Orpheus from death—both involve a mother’s grief over the absence of a child.  See also <ref target="#kpl1.44">Keats’s note to PL 2.546-52</ref> citing instances of “the sublime pathetic” in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title>.</p>
         
         <p>Keats’s emphasis in this note on Milton’s originality was a point often made by other Romantic writers.  Hazlitt, for example, observes that <q>“Milton has borrowed more than any other writer; yet he is perfectly distinct from every other writer.  The power of his mind is stamped on every line.  He is a writer of centos, and yet in originality only inferior to Homer”</q> (<title>“On Milton’s Versification”</title> 4: 37; a similar passage appears in <title>“On Shakespeare and Milton”</title> 5: 58).  Newlyn discusses Hazlitt’s remarks as part of a tradition that began in the eighteenth century, in which Milton was considered a rare example of a highly original writer who depended heavily on earlier sources (47). Keats also stresses Milton’s (and all writers’) uniqueness in <ref target="#kpl1.5">his note to 1.59-94</ref> when he writes, <q>“A Poet can seldom have justice done to his imagination—for men are as distinct in their conception of material shadowings as they are in matters of spiritual understanding.”</q></p>

         By the <q>“original”</q> meaning of <q>“reluctant,”</q> Keats is probably thinking of  “struggling” or “writhing”; the <q>“modern meaning”</q> would be “unwilling, averse; disinclined to do something” (<title rend="italic">OED Online</title>; accessed 12 Oct. 2018).  Interestingly, the <title rend="italic">OED</title> cites <title rend="italic">PL</title> 6.58 to illustrate the modern meaning of <q>“reluctant”</q> and <ref target="#kpl2.125.0515l"><title rend="italic">PL</title> 10.515</ref> (<q>“down [Satan] fell, / A monstrous serpent on his belly prone, / Reluctant, but in vain”</q>) to illustrate the earlier meaning.  Keats uses the modern meaning of the word in <title rend="italic">Hyperion</title> 1.60-61:  <q>“Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, / Rumbles reluctant o’er our fallen house.”</q>

         Milton in every instance pursues his imagination to the utmost&mdash;he is '<q source="#kpl2.119.0281l">sagacious of his Quarry</q>' he sees Beauty on the wing, pounces upon it and gorges it to the producing his essential verse '<q source="#kpl1.130.0479l #kpl1.130.0480l">So from the root the springs lighter the green stalk</q>' &amp;[c.]&mdash;but in no instance is this sort of perseverance more exemplified than in what may be called his <emph rend="su">stationing or statu[a]ry</emph>: He is not content with simple description, he must station&mdash;Thus here, we not only see how the Birds '<q source="#kpl2.043.0422l" rend="su">with clang despised the ground</q>' but we see them '<q source="#kpl2.043.0422l #kpl2.043.0423l" rend="su">under a cloud in prospect</q>' So we see Adam '<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl1.098.0477l">Fair indeed and tall</q></emph>&mdash;<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl1.098.0478l">under a plantane</q></emph> and so we see Satan '<emph rend="su"><q source="#kpl1.088.0127l">disfigured</q></emph>&mdash;<emph rend="su"><q source="kpl1.088.0126l">on the Assyrian Mount</q></emph>' This last with all its accompaniments, and keeping in mind the &mdash;Theory of Spirits eyes and the simile of Gallilio, has a dramatic&mdash;&mdash;vastness and solemnity fit and worthy to hold one amazed in the midst of this Paradise Lost&mdash;

         Richard Woodhouse noted a parallel between lines 438-40 and Keats’s <title>“Imitation of Spenser”</title> 14-15: “There saw the swan his neck of arched snow, / And oar’d himself along with majesty” (Sperry, <title>“Woodhouse’s Interleaved and Annotated Copy”</title> 144-45).

         <p>Both Finney (1: 339-40) and W. J. Bate (244-46) link Keats’s celebration of Milton’s intensity in this note to Hazlitt’s concept of <q>“gusto.”</q> In his <title rend="italic">Round Table</title> essay <title>“On Gusto”</title> Hazlitt writes, <q>“Milton has great gusto.  He repeats his blows twice; grapples with and exhausts his subject”</q> (4: 79).  In <title>“On Milton’s Versification,”</title> also from <title rend="italic">The Round Table</title>, Hazlitt states that <q>“Milton had as much of what is meant by <emph rend="italic">gusto</emph> as any poet.  He forms the most intense conception of things, and then embodies them by a single stroke of his pen.  Force of style is perhaps his first excellence”</q> (4: 38).  Keats reports reading Hazlitt’s <title rend="italic">Round Table</title> with Bailey in September 1817 (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 166).</p>
         
         <p>The term <q>“stationing”</q> derives from theories of the visual arts and refers to the positioning of figures within a particular setting.  Keats’s remarks on Milton’s <q>“stationing or statu[a]ry”</q> are similar to comments Hazlitt makes in his essay <title>“On Shakespeare and Milton”</title> (5: 59-60).  See the Introduction (section on “Themes and Patterns in the Marginalia: Descriptive Passages”) for further discussion of these points.  </p> <!-- LINK??? XYZ -->
         
         <p>It is not clear what <q>“Theory of Spirits eyes”</q> Keats is alluding to in this note, but presumably it involves the superior visual power spirits or angels are thought to possess.  Keats writes <q>“A Spirit’s eye”</q> alongside an earlier passage in which Satan lands on the sun and gazes on the brilliant scene <q>“Undazzled, far and wide his eye commands, / For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, / But all sunshine”</q> (<ref target="#kpl1.078.0614l">3.614-16</ref>).  Another passage that refers to spirits’ enhanced eyesight is <ref target="#kpl1.005.0059l">PL 1.59-60</ref> (which Keats underscores): <q>“At once, as far as Angel’s ken, he [Satan] views / The dismal situation waste and wild.”</q></p>
         
         <p>Three similes in <title rend="italic">Paradise Lost</title> allude to Galileo, all involving his telescope and all marked by Keats: <ref target="#kpl1.011.0287l">1.287-91</ref>, <ref target="#kpl1.077.0588l">3.588-90</ref>, and <ref target="#kpl1.124.0261l">5.261-63</ref>.  Galileo’s telescope in Milton’s accounts is similar (though inferior) to the vision of angels in that it allows clear perception of far-off objects and reveals hitherto unknown features of the moon and sun. </p>
         
         <p>The passage Keats cites in relation to the <q>“Theory of Spirits eyes and the simile of Gallilio”</q> (<q>“Satan <q>‘disfigured on the Assyrian Mount’</q>”</q>) depicts Satan as he is viewed by the archangel Uriel.  Satan previously had disguised himself as an angel and fooled Uriel into giving him directions to Eden.  At this point, however, when his face is distorted by <q>“ire, envy, and despair”</q> (<ref target="#kpl1.088.0115l">PL 4.115</ref>), Satan reveals his true, tormented self, while he thinks himself alone and doesn’t realize that he is being observed by Uriel. The dramatic <q>“vastness and solemnity”</q> Keats perceives in this image therefore would seem to involve the pathetic irony of a being who once looked on his surroundings with supernatural keenness of perception, but whose fallen condition has now made him, all unaware, the sorry object of a superior angel’s penetrating gaze.

         Compare the passage ending “Had lively shadow'd" (line 311) to the well-known passage from Keats’s 22 November 1817 letter to Bailey: <q>“The Imagination may be compared to Adam’s dream—he awoke and found it truth. . . . It is <q>‘a Vision in the form of Youth’</q> a Shadow of reality to come”</q> (<title rend="italic">Letters</title> 1: 185).  Keats does not mark the other passage in which Adam’s dream becomes reality: when he dreams of Eve and wakes to find her presented to him by God (<ref target="#kpl2.066.0461l">8.461-90</ref>).

         <p>As other editors note, Keats's <q>“prosiable”</q> appears to be a combination of “probable” and “possible” (compare Forman 5: 305; Barnard 526; Cook 614).  Wolfson suggests that Keats may also have had in mind “‘prosy’ (wearisome)” (237).  Keats may have begun writing with one word in mind and then switched to the other, or he may have intentionally coined a new term to express his meaning.</p>
         
         <p>Both W. J. Bate (254) and Meg Williams (117) cite Keats's note as illustrative of his gift for empathy or “negative capability.” Nicola Trott, however, points out that Satan does not lose his own identity as he takes on the form of the serpent but instead retains his own consciousness and finds the experience of inhabiting another body oppressive (<title>“Keats and the Prison House”</title> 263-64).  Allott (411) compares this note to <title rend="italic">Hyperion</title> 1.258-63; Cook (614) suggests a comparison to The Eve of St. Agnes 17-18.</p>

         Line 330 (<q>“his children dear”</q>) would seem to be another example of what Keats considers <q>“the sublime pathetic”</q> in Milton.  See his <ref target="#kpl1.44">note to <title rend="italic">PL</title> 2.546-52</ref>, where he cites as an instance of the sublime pathetic <q>“where Satan’s progeny is called his <q>‘daughter dear’</q>.”</q>  Keats, however, does not underscore similar passages on the next two pages referring to Sin as Satan’s “offspring dear,” “fair / Enchanting daughter,” and “Fair daughter” (<ref target="#kpl2.121.0349l">10.349</ref>, <ref target="#kpl2.121.0352l">352-53</ref>, <ref target="#kpl2.122.0384l">384</ref>).  Perhaps Keats began to perceive in these latter passages not pathos but sinister irony, as Satan cherishes and flatters the hideous offspring who collaborate with him on bringing about the suffering of mankind.
