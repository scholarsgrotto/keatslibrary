                  The Genius of Milton, more particularly in respect to its span in immensity, calculated
                  him, by a sort of birthright, for such an 'argument' as the paradise lost. he had
                  an exquisite passion for what is properly in the sense of ease and pleasure poetical
                  Luxury—and with that it appears to me he would fain have been content if he could
                  so doing have preserved his self respect and feel of duty perform'd—but there was
                  working in him as it were that same sort of thing as operates in the great world to
                  the end of a Prophecy's being accomplish'd—therefore he devoted himself rather to
                  the Ardours than the pleasures of Song, solacing himself at intervals with cups of
                  old wine—and those are with some exceptions the finest parts of the Poem. <span class="strikeThrough">In some par</span> With some exceptions—for the spirit of mounting and adventure can never be unfruitful
                  or unrewarded—had he not broken through the clouds which envellope so deliciously
                  the Elysian field of Verse and committed himself to the Extreme we never should have
                  seen Satan as described

                  There is a greatness which the Paradise Lost possesses over every other Poem—<span class="single_underline ">the Magnitude of Contrast</span> and that is softened by the contrast being ungrotesque to a degree—Heaven moves on
                  like music throughout—Hell is also peopled with angels it also move[s] on like music

            The first Book proposes, first in brief, the whole subject, Man's disobedience, and
            the loss thereupon of Paradise wherein he was placed: Then touches the prime cause
            of his fall, the Serpent, or rather Satan in the serpent; who, revolting from God,
            and drawing to his side many legions of Angels, was, by the command of God, driven
            out of Heaven with all his crew into the great deep. Which action passed over, the
            poem hastens into the midst of things, presenting Satan with his Angels now falling
            into Hell described here, not in the centre (for Heaven and Earth may be supposed
            not as yet made, certainly not yet accursed), but in a place of utter darkness, fitliest
            called Chaos: Here Satan with his Angels lying on the burning lake, thunder-struck
            and astonished, after a certain space recovers, as from confusion, calls up him who
            next in order and dignity lay by him: they confer of their miserable fall; Satan awakens
            all his legions, who lay till then in the same manner confounded. They rise, their
            numbers, array of battle, their chief leaders named, according to the idols known
            afterwards in Canaan and the countries adjoining. To these Satan directs his speech,
            comforts them with hope yet of regaining Heaven, but tells them lastly of a new world
            and new kind of creature to be created, according to an ancient prophecy or report
            in Heaven; for that Angels were long before this visible creation, was the opinion
            of many Fathers. To find out the truth of this prophecy, and what to determine thereon,
            he refers to a full council. What his associates thence attempt. Pandemonium, the
            palace of Satan, rises, suddenly built out of the deep: The infernal peers there sit
            in council.

                  One of the most mysterious of semi-speculations is, one would suppose, that of one
                  Mind's imagining into another Things may be described by a Man's self in parts so

                  A Poet can seldom have justice done to his imagination—for men are as distinct in
                  their conceptions of material shadowings as they are in matters of spiritual understanding—it
                  can scarcely be conceived how Milton's Blindness might here ade the magnitude of his

                  There is a cool pleasure in the very sound of vale—The english word is of the happiest
                  chance. Milton has put vales in heaven and hell with the very utter affection and
                  yearning of a great Poet. It is a sort of delphic Abstraction a beautiful thing made
                  more beautiful by being reflected and put in a Mist. The Next mention of Vale is one
                  of the most pathetic in the whole range of Poetry <a href="#kpl77">'Others more mild, retreated in a Silent Valley'</a>&amp;[c]. How much of the charm is in the Valley!—

            By our delay? no, rather let us choose,<br>
            Arm'd with Hell flames and fury, all at once<br>
            O'er Heaven's high Towers to force resistless way,<br>
            Turning our Tortures into horrid arms<br>
            Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise<br>

            Of some new race call'd Man, about this time<br>

            In power and excellence, but favour'd more<br>
            Of Him who rules above; so was his will<br>
            Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath,<br>

            Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br>

            Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br>

            shews him to the Son who sat at his right hand; foretells the success of Satan in
            perverting mankind; clears his own justice and wisdom from all imputation, having
            created Man free, and able enough to have withstood his tempter; yet declares his
            purpose of grace towards him, in regard he fell not of his own malice, as did Satan,
            but by him seduced. The Son of God renders praises to his Father for the manifestation
            of his gracious purpose towards Man: but God again declares, that Grace cannot be
            extended towards Man without the satisfaction of divine justice: Man hath offended
            the majesty of God by aspiring to Godhead, and therefore, with all his progeny, devoted
            to death, must die, unless some one can be found sufficient to answer for his offence,
            and undergo his punishment. The Son of God freely offers himself a ransom for Man;
            the Father accepts him, ordains his incarnation, pronounces his exaltation above all
            names in Heaven and Earth; commands all the Angels to adore him; they obey, and hymning
            to their harps in full quire, celebrate the Father and the Son. Meanwhile Satan alights
            upon the bare convex of this world's outermost orb; where wandering he first finds
            a place, since called the Limbo of vanity; what persons and things fly up thither:
            thence comes to the gate of Heaven, described ascending by stairs, and the waters
            above the firmament that flow about it: His passage thence to the orb of the sun;
            he finds there Uriel the regent of that orb, but first changes himeself into the shape
            of a meaner Angel: and pretending a zealous desire to behold the new creation, and
            Man whom God had placed here, inqures of him the place of his habitation, and is directed:
            alights first on mount Niphates.</span><br>

            Useless and vain, of freedom both despoil'd,<br>
            Made passive both, had served necessity,<br>

            Their maker, or their making, or their fate,<br>
            As if predestination overruled<br>
            Their will, disposed by absolute decree<br>
            Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed<br>
            Their own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,<br>
            Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br>

            So without least impulse or shadow of fate,<br>
            Or ought by me immutably foreseen,<br>
            They trespass, authors to themselves in all<br>
            Both what they judge and what they choose; for so<br>
            I form'd them free, and free they must remain,<br>
            Till they inthrall themselves; I else must change<br>
            Their nature, and revoke the high decree<br>
            Unchangeable, eternal, which ordain'd<br>
            Their freedom; they themselves ordain'd their fall.<br>
            The first sort by their own suggestion fell,<br>
            Self-tempted, self-depraved: Man falls, deceived<br>

            By model, or by shading pencil drawn.<br>

            Each stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br>

            Viewless, and underneath a bright sea flow'd<br>

            enterprise which he undertook alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with
            himself, and many passions, fear, envy, and despair; but at length confirms himself
            in evil, journeys on to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described;
            overleaps the bounds; sits in the shape of a cormorant on the tree of life, as highest
            in the garden, to look about him. The garden described; Satan's first sight of Adam
            and Eve; his wonder at their excellent form and happy state, but with resolution to
            work their fall; overhears their discourse, thence gathers that the tree of knowledge
            was forbidden them to eat of, under penalty of death; and thereon intends to found
            his temptation, by seducing them to transgress: then leaves them awhile, to know further
            of their state by some other means. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sun-beam, warns
            Gabriel, who had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had escaped
            the deep, and passed at noon by his sphere, in the shape of a good Angel, down to
            Paradise, discovered after by his furious gestures in the mount. Gabriel promises
            to find him ere morning. Night coming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their
            rest: their bower described; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands
            of night-watch to walk the round of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to Adam's
            bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping:
            there they find him at the ear of Eve, tempting her in a dream, and bring him, though
            unwilling, to Gabriel; by whom questioned, he scornfully answers; prepares resistance;
            but, hindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise.</span><br>

            <span class="left_vertical ">What feign'd submission swore! ease would recant</span><br>

            Short intermission bought with double smart.<br>
            This knows my punisher; therefore as far<br>
            From granting he, as I from begging peace:<br>
            All hope excluded thus, behold in stead<br>
            Of us, outcast, exiled, his new delight,<br>
            Mankind created, and for him this world.<br>
            So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear,<br>
            Farewell remorse: all good to me is lost;<br>
            Evil be thou my good; by thee at least<br>
            Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,<br>
            By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign;<br>
            As Man ere long, and this new world, shall know.<br>

            Are ever clear.  Whereof he soon aware,<br>
            Each pertubation smooth'd with outward calm,<br>
            Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br>
            That practised falsehood under saintly show,<br>
            Deep malice to conceal, couch'd with revenge:<br>
            Yet not enough had practised to deceive<br>
            Uriel once warn'd; whose eye pursued him down<br>

            <span class="single_underline ">Watching where shpherds pen their flocks at eve</span><br>

            Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,<br>
            The middle tree and highest there that grew,<br>
            Sat like a cormorant; yet not true life<br>
            Thereby regain'd, but sat devising death<br>
            To them who lived; nor on the virtue thought<br>
            Of that life-giving plant, but only used<br>
            For prospect, what well used had been the pledge<br>
            Of immortality.  So little knows<br>

            <span class="single_underline ">Both of her beauty, and submissive charms,</span><br>

            For envy, yet with jealous leer malign<br>
            Eyed them askance; and to himself thus plain'd.<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   Sight hateful, sight tormenting; thus these two,<br>

            Of bliss on bliss: while I to Hell am thrust,<br>
            Where neither joy, nor love, but fierce desire,<br>
            Amongst our other torments not the least,<br>
            Still unfulfill'd with pain of longing, pines.<br>
            Yet let me not forget what I have gain'd<br>

            One fatal Tree there stands, of Knowledge call'd,<br>
            Forbidden them to taste.  Knowledge forbidden?<br>
            Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should their Lord<br>
            Envy them that? can it be sin to know?<br>
            Can it be death? and do they only stand<br>
            By ignorance? Is that their happy state,<br>
            The proof of their obedience, and their faith?<br>
            O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br>
            Their ruin; hence I will excite their minds<br>
            With more desire to know, and to reject<br>
            Envious commands, invented with design<br>
            To keep them low, whom knowledge might exalt<br>

            Torment with ease, and soonest recompense<br>
            Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br>
            To thee no reason, who knowst only good,<br>

            Unlicensed, from his bounds in Hell prescribed;<br>
            So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br>
            However, and to 'scape his punishment!<br>
            So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath,<br>
            Which thou incurrst by flying, meet thy flight<br>
            Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br>
            Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br>
            Can equal anger infinite provoked.<br>
            But wherefore thou alone? Wherefore with thee<br>

            enterprise which he undertook alone against God and Man, falls into many doubts with
            himself, and many passions, fear, envy, and despair; but at length confirms himself
            in evil, journeys on to Paradise, whose outward prospect and situation is described;
            overleaps the bounds; sits in the shape of a cormorant on the tree of life, as highest
            in the garden, to look about him. The garden described; Satan's first sight of Adam
            and Eve; his wonder at their excellent form and happy state, but with resolution to
            work their fall; overhears their discourse, thence gathers that the tree of knowledge
            was forbidden them to eat of, under penalty of death; and thereon intends to found
            his temptation, by seducing them to transgress: then leaves them awhile, to know further
            of their state by some other means. Meanwhile Uriel, descending on a sun-beam, warns
            Gabriel, who had in charge the gate of Paradise, that some evil Spirit had escaped
            the deep, and passed at noon by his sphere, in the shape of a good Angel, down to
            Paradise, discovered after by his furious gestures in the mount. Gabriel promises
            to find him ere morning. Night coming on, Adam and Eve discourse of going to their
            rest: their bower described; their evening worship. Gabriel, drawing forth his bands
            of night-watch to walk the round of Paradise, appoints two strong Angels to Adam's
            bower, lest the evil Spirit should be there doing some harm to Adam or Eve sleeping:
            there they find him at the ear of Eve, tempting her in a dream, and bring him, though
            unwilling, to Gabriel; by whom questioned, he scornfully answers; prepares resistance;
            but, hindered by a sign from Heaven, flies out of Paradise.</span><br>

            To this high exaltation; suddenly<br>
            My guide was gone, and I methought, sunk down,<br>
            And fell asleep; but O, how glad I waked<br>
            To find this but a dream!—Thus Eve her night<br>
            Related, and thus Adam answer'd sad.<br>

            The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br>
            Affects me equally; nor can I like<br>
            This uncouth dream, of evil sprung, I fear;<br>
            Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,<br>
            Created pure.  But know, that in the soul<br>
            Are many lesser faculties, that serve<br>
            Reason as chief; <span class="single_underline ">among these Fancy next</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Her office holds; of all external things,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Which the five watchful senses represent,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">She forms imaginations, airy shapes,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Which Reason, joining, or disjoining, frames</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">All what we affirm or what deny, and call</span><br>

            Some such resemblances, methinks, I find<br>

            Evil into the mind of God or Man<br>
            May come and go, so unapproved, and leave<br>
            No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope,<br>
            That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream,<br>
            Waking thou never wilt consent to do.<br>
            Be not dishearten'd then, nor cloud those looks,<br>
            That wont to be more cheerful and serene<br>
            Than when fair morning first smiles on the world;<br>
            And let us to our fresh employments rise<br>
            Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers,<br>
            That open now <span class="single_underline ">their choicest bosom'd smells,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store</span>.<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   So cheer'd he his fair spouse, and she was cheer'd;<br>

            Who can in reason then, or right, assume<br>

            Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn<br>
            The just decree of God, pronounced and sworn,<br>
            That to his only Son by right endued<br>
            With regal scepter, every soul in Heaven<br>
            Shall bend the knee, and in that honour due<br>
            Confess him rightful King? Unjust, thou sayst,<br>
            Flatly unjust, to bind with laws the free,<br>
            And equal over equals to let reign,<br>
            One over all with unsucceeded power.<br>
            Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute<br>
            With him the points of liberty, who made<br>
            Thee what thou art, and form'd the Powers of Heaven<br>
            Such as he pleased, and circumscribed their being?<br>
            Yet, by experience taught, we know how good,<br>
            And of our good and of our dignity<br>
            How provident he is; how far from thought<br>
            To make us less, bent rather to exalt<br>
            Our happy state under one head more near<br>
            United.  But to grant it thee unjust,<br>
            That equal over equals monarch reign;<br>
            Thyself, though great and glorious, dost thou count,<br>
            Or all angelic nature join'd in one,<br>
            Equal to him begotten Son? by whom,<br>
            As by his Word, the Mighty Father made<br>
            All things, even thee; and all the Spirits of Heaven<br>
            By him created in their bright degrees,<br>
            Crown'd them with glory, and to their glory named<br>
            Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Virtues, Powers,<br>
            Essential Powers: nor by his reign obscured,<br>
            But more illustrious made; since he the head<br>
            One of our number thus reduced becomes;<br>
            His laws our laws; all honour to him done<br>
            Returns our own.  Cease then this impious rage,<br>
            And tempt not these; but hasten to appease<br>
            The incensed Father, and the incensed Son,<br>
            While pardon may be found in time besought.<br>

            Satan and his Angels. The first fight described; Satan and his powers retire under
            night: He calls a council, invents devilish engines, which, in the second day's fight
            put Michael and his Angels to some disorder; but they at length, pulling up mountains,
            overwhelmed both the force and machines of Satan: yet the tumult not so ending, God
            on the third day sends Messiah, his Son, for whom he had reserved the glory of that
            victory: He, in the power of his Father, coming to the place, and causing all his
            legions to stand still on either side, with his chariot and thunder driving into the
            midst of his enemies, pursues them unable to resist towards the wall of Heaven; which
            opening, they leap down with horror and confusion into the place of punishment prepared
            for them in the deep: Messiah returns with triumph to his Father.</span><br>

            Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,<br>
            So under fiery cope together rush'd<br>
            Both battles main, with ruinous assault<br>

            A legion; led in fight, yet leader seem'd<br>

            When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br>

            <span class="single_underline ">The ridges of grim war</span>: No thought of flight,<br>

            For seasons, and for days, and circling years;<br>

            And sow'd with stars the Heaven thick as a field:<br>
            Of light by far the greater part he took,<br>

            In the sun's orb, made porous to receive<br>

            So far remote, with diminution seen.<br>
            First in his east the glorious lamp was seen,<br>
            Regent of day, and all the horizon round<br>
            Invested with bright rays, jocund to run<br>
            His longitude, through Heaven's high road: the grey<br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Dawn, and the Pleiades, before him danced,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Shedding sweet influence: Less bright the moon,</span><br>

            And brute as other creatures, but endued<br>
            With sanctity of reason, might erect<br>
            His stature, and upright, with front serene,<br>
            Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence<br>
            Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven,<br>
            But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br>
            Descends, thither with heart, and voice, and eyes,<br>
            Directed in devotion, to adore<br>
            And worship God Supreme, who made him chief <br>
            Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent<br>
            Eternal Father (for where is not he<br>
            Present?) thus to his Son audibly spake.<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br>
            In our similitude, and let them rule<br>

            Beast of the field, and over all the Earth,<br>
            And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.<br>
            This said, he form'd thee, Adam, thee, O Man,<br>
            Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breathed<br>

            With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went,<br>
            Not unattended; for on her as queen<br>
            <span class="left_vertical ">A pomp of winning graces waited still,</span><br>

            His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years;<br>

            Imports nots, if thou reckon right; the rest<br>
            From Man or Angel the great Architect<br>
            Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br>
            His secrets to be scann'd by them who ought<br>
            Rather admire; or, if they list to try<br>
            Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heavens<br>
            Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move<br>
            His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br>
            Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven<br>
            And calculate the stars, how they will wield<br>
            The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive<br>
            To save appearances; <span class="single_underline ">how gird the sphere</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">With centric and eccentric scribbled o'er</span>,<br>
            Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:<br>

            Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest<br>
            That bodies bright and greater should not serve<br>
            The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,<br>
            Earth sitting still, when she alone receives<br>
            The benefit. Consider first, that great<br>
            Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth,<br>

            <span class="right_vertical ">Not glistering, may of solid good contain</span><br>

            And for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak<br>
            The Maker's high magnificence, who built<br>
            So spacious, and his line stretch'd out so far;<br>
            That Man may know he dwells not in his own;<br>

            Lodged in a small partition; and the rest<br>
            Ordain'd for uses to his Lord best known.<br>
            The swiftness of those circles attribute,<br>
            Though numberless, to his omnipotence,<br>
            That to corporeal substances could add<br>
            Speed almost spiritual: Me thou thinkst not slow,<br>
            Who since the morning hour set out from Heaven<br>
            Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived<br>
            In Eden, distance inexpressible<br>
            By numbers that have name. But this I urge,<br>
            Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show<br>
            Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;<br>
            Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br>
            To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br>
            God, to remove his ways from human sense,<br>
            Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,<br>
            If it presume, might err in things too high,<br>
            And no advantage gain. What if the sun<br>
            Be centre to the world, and other stars,<br>
            By his attractive virtue and their own<br>
            Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br>
            Their wandering course now high, now low, then hid,<br>
            Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br>
            In six thou seest, and what if seventh to these<br>
            The planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,<br>

            In all things else delight indeed, but such<br>
            As used or not, works in the mind no change, <br>

            I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers, <br>
            Walks, and the melody of birds; but here<br>
            Far otherwise, transported I behold, <br>
            Transported touch; here passion first I felt, <br>
            Commotion strange! in all enjoyments else<br>
            Superior and unmoved; here only weak<br>
            Against the charm of Beauty's powerful glance. <br>
            Or Nature fail'd in me, and left some part<br>
            Not proof enough such object to sustain; <br>
            Or from my side subducting, took perhaps<br>
            More than enough; at least on her bestow'd<br>
            Too much of ornament, in outward show<br>
            Elaborate, of inward less exact. <br>
            For well I understand in the prime end<br>
            Of Nature her the inferior, in the mind<br>
            And inward faculties, which most excel; <br>
            In outward also her resembling less<br>
            His image who made both, and less expressing<br>
            The character of that dominion given<br>
            O'er other creatures; yet when I approach<br>
            Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br>
            And in herself complete, so well to know<br>
            Her own, that what she wills to do or say, <br>
            Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best; <br>
            All higher knowledge in her presence falls<br>
            Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her<br>
            Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows; <br>
            Authority and Reason on her wait, <br>
            As one intended first, not after made<br>
            Occasionally; and, to consummate all, <br>
            Greatness of mind, and Nobleness, their seat<br>
            Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br>
            About her, as a guard angelic placed. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span><span class="single_underline ">To whom the Angel with contracted brow</span>. <br>

            Dismiss not her, when most thou needs her nigh, <br>
            By attributing overmuch to things<br>
            Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest. <br>
            For, what admirest thou, what transports thee so, <br>
            An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well<br>
            Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, <br>
            Not thy subjection: weigh with her thyself; <br>
            Then value: Ofttimes nothing profits more<br>
            Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br>
            Well managed; of that skill the more thou knowst, <br>
            The more she will acknowledge thee her head, <br>
            And to realities yield all her shows:<br>
            Made so adorn for thy delight the more, <br>
            So awful, that with honour thou mayst love<br>
            Thy mate, who sees when thou are seen least wise. <br>
            But if the sense of touch, whereby mankind<br>
            Is propagated, seem such dear delight<br>
            Beyond all other, think the same vouchsafed<br>
            To cattle and each beast; which would not be<br>

            Therein enjoy'd were worthy to subdue<br>
            The soul of man, or passion in him move. <br>
            What higher in her society thou findst<br>
            Attractive, human, rational, love still; <br>
            In loving thou dost well, in passion not, <br>
            Wherein true love consists not: Love refines<br>
            The thoughts, and heart enlarges; hath his seat<br>
            In reason, and is judicious; is the scale<br>
            By which to heavenly love thou mayst ascend; <br>
            Not sunk in carnal please; for which cause, <br>
            Among the beasts no mate for thee was found. <br>

            into Paradise; enters into the serpent sleeping. Adam and Eve in the morning go forth
            to their labours, which Eve proposes to divide in several places, each labouring apart:
            Adam consents not, alleging the danger, lest that enemy, of whom they were forewarned,
            should attempt her found alone: Eve, loath to be thought not circumspect or firm enough,
            urges her going apart, the rather desirous to make trial of her strength; Adam at
            last yields: The Serpent finds her alone; his subtle approach, first gazing, then
            speaking; with much flattery extolling Eve above all other creatures. Eve, wondering
            to hear the Serpent speak, asks how he attained to human speech and such understanding
            not till now; the Serpent answers, that by tasting of a certain tree in the garden
            he attained to both speech and reason, till then void of both: Eve requires him to
            bring her to that tree, and finds it to be the tree of knowledge forbidden: The Serpent,
            now grown bolder, with many wiles and arguments, induces her at length to eat; she,
            pleased with the taste, deliberates awhile whether to impart thereof to Adam or not;
            at last brings him of the fruit; relates what persuaded her to eat thereof: Adam,
            at first amazed, but perceiving her lost, resolves, through vehemence of love, to
            perish with her; and, extenuating the trespass, eats also of the fruit: The effects
            thereof in them both: they seek to cover their nakedness; then fall to variance and
            accusation of another.</span><br>

            Conjugal love, than which perhaps no bliss<br>

            Can either not receive, or can repel. <br>
            His fraud is then thy fear;  which plain infers<br>
            Thy equal fear, that my firm faith and love<br>
            Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced; <br>

            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   To whom with healing words Adam replied. <br>
            Daughter of God and Man, Immortal Eve, <br>

            Not diffident of thee do I dissuade<br>
            Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid<br>

            The tempted with dishonor foul, supposed<br>
            Not incorruptible of faith, not proof<br>
            Against temptation: Thou thyself with scorn<br>

            Though ineffectual found; misdeem not then, <br>
            If such affront I labour to avert<br>
            From thee alone, which on us both at once<br>
            The enemy, though bold, will hardly dare, <br>
            Or daring, first on me the assault shall light. <br>
            Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn ; <br>
            Subtle he needs must be, who could seduce <br>
            Angels; nor think superfluous others aid. <br>
            I, from the influence of thy looks, receive<br>

            Of our integrity: his foul esteem <br>
            Sticks no dishonor on our front, but turns<br>
            Foul on himself: then wherefore shunn'd or fear'd <br>
            By us? who rather double honour gain<br>
            From his surmise proved false, find peace within, <br>
            Favour from heaven, our witness, from the event. <br>
            And what is faith, love, virtue, unassay'd <br>
            Alone, without exterior help sustain'd ?<br>

            Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins, <br>

            Of guile, of hate, of envy, of revenge; <br>
            But the hot Hell that always in him burns,<br>
            Though in mid heaven, soon ended his delight, <br>
            And tortures him now more, the more he sees<br>
            Of pleasure, not for him ordain'd: then soon<br>
            Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts<br>

            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   To whom the guileful Tempter thus replie.<br>
            Empress of this fair world, resplendent Eve!<br>
            Easy to me it is to tell thee all<br>
            What thou commandest; and right thou shouldst be obey'd:<br>
            I was at first as other beasts that graze <br>
            The trodden herb, of abject thoughts and low, <br>
            As was my food: nor aught but food discern'd <br>
            Or sex, and apprehended nothing high: <br>
            Till on a day roving the field, I chanced <br>
            A goodly fair tree far distant to behold<br>
            Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mix'd, <br>
            Ruddy and gold: I nearer drew to gaze; <br>
            <span class="single_underline ">When from the boughs a savoury odour blown,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Grateful to appetite, more pleased my sense</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Than smell of sweetest fennel, or the teats</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even, </span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Unsuck'd of lamb or kid, that tend their play</span>. <br>
            To satisfy the sharp desire I had <br>
            Of tasting those fair apples, I resolved<br>
            Not to defer; hunger and thirst at once, <br>
            Powerful persuaders, quicken'd at the scent <br>
            Of that alluring fruit, urged me so keen. <br>
            <span class="single_underline ">About the mossy trunk I wound me</span> soon; <br>
            For high from ground the branches would require<br>
            Thy utmost reach or Adam's: Round the tree<br>
            All other beasts that saw, with like desire<br>
            Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. <br>
            Amid the tree now got, where plenty hung <br>
            Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill<br>
            <span class="left_vertical ">I spared not;  for, such pleasure till that hour</span><br>
            <span class="left_vertical ">At feed or fountain, never had I found.</span><br>

            Things in their causes, but to trace the ways <br>
            Of highest agents, deem'd however wise. <br>
            Queen of this universe! do not believe<br>
            Those rigid threats of death; ye shall not die:<br>
            How should you? By the fruit? It gives you life<br>
            To knowledge; by the threatener? look on me, <br>
            Me, who have touch'd and tasted; yet both live, <br>
            And life more perfect have attain'd than Fate<br>
            Meant me, by venturing higher than my lot. <br>
            Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast<br>
            Is open? Or will God incense his ire<br>
            For such a petty trespass? and not praise <br>
            Rather your dauntless virtue, whom the pain<br>
            Of death denounced, whatever thing death be, <br>
            Deterr'd not from atchieving what might lead <br>
            To happier life, knowledge of good and evil? <br>
            Of good, how just? Of evil, if what is evil<br>
            Be real, why not known, since easier shunn'd? <br>
            God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; <br>
            Not just, not God; not fear'd then, nor obey'd: <br>
            Your fear itself of death removes the fear. <br>
            Why then was this forbid?  Why, but to awe; <br>
            Why, but to keep ye low and ignorant, <br>
            His worshippers? He knows that in the day <br>
            Ye eat thereof, your eyes that seem so clear, <br>

            The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br>

            That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains<br>
            Wisdom without their leave? And wherein lies<br>
            The offence, that Man should thus attain to know? <br>
            What can your knowledge hurt him, or this tree<br>
            Impart against his will, if all be his? <br>
            Or is it envy, and can envy dwell<br>
            In heavenly breasts? These, these, and many more<br>

            Pausing a while, thus to herself she mused. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   Great are thy virtues, doubtless, best of fruits,<br>
            Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admired;<br>
            Whose taste, too long forlorn, at first assay<br>
            Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br>
            The tongue not made for speech, to speak thy praise: <br>
            Thy praise he also, who forbids thy use, <br>
            Conceals not from us, naming thee the tree<br>
            Of knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; <br>
            Forbids us then to taste! But his forbidding<br>
            Commends thee more, while it infers the good<br>
            By thee communicated, and our want: <br>
            For good unknown, sure is not had, or, had<br>
            And yet unknown, is as not had at all. <br>
            In plain then, what forbids he but to know, <br>
            Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? <br>
            Such prohibitions bind not. But, if death<br>
            Bind us with after-bands, what profits then <br>
            Our inward freedom? In the day we eat <br>
            Of this fair fruit, our doom is, we shall die! <br>
            How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives, <br>
            And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, <br>
            Irrational till then. For us alone<br>
            Was death invented? or to us denied<br>
            This intellectual food, for beasts reserved?<br>
            For beasts it seems: yet that one beast which first<br>
            Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy<br>
            The good befallen him, author unsuspected, <br>
            Friendly to Man, far from deceit or guile. <br>
            What fear I then? rather, what know to fear<br>
            Under this ignorance of good and evil, <br>
            Of God or death, of law or penalty? <br>
            Here grows the cure of all, this fruit divine, <br>
            Fair to the eye, inviting to the taste,<br>

            This tree is not, as we are told, a tree<br>

            Opening the way, but of divine effect<br>

            Hath eaten of the fruit; and is become, <br>
            Not dead as we are threaten'd, but thenceforth <br>
            Endued with human voice and human sense, <br>
            Reasoning to admiration; and with me<br>
            Persuasively hath so prevail'd, that I <br>
            Have also tasted, and have also found<br>
            The effects to correspond; opener my eyes,<br>
            Dim erst, dilated spirits, ampler heart, <br>
            And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br>
            Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. <br>
            For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss; <br>
            Tedious, unshared with thee, and odious soon. <br>
            Thou therefore also taste, that equal lot<br>
            May join us, equal joy, as equal love: <br>
            Lest thou not tasting, different degree<br>
            Disjoin us, and I then too late renounce <br>
            Deity for thee, when Fate will not permit.<br>

            Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate; yet so<br>

            No ground of enmity between us known, <br>
            Why he should mean me ill, or seek to harm. <br>
            Was I to have never parted from thy side? <br>
            As good have grown there still a lifeless rib. <br>
            Being as I am, why didst not thou, the head, <br>
            Command me absolutely not to go, <br>
            Going into such danger, as thou saidst? <br>
            Too facile then, thou didst not much gainsay; <br>

            Heaven to approve their vigilance, and are approved; God declaring that the entrance
            of Satan could not be by them prevented. He sends his Son to judge the transgressors;
            who descends, and gives sentence accordingly; then in pity clothes them both, and
            re-ascends. Sin and Death sitting till then at the gates of Hell, by wonderous sympathy
            feeling the success of Satan in this new world, and the sin by Man there committed,
            resolve to sit no longer confined in Hell, but to follow Satan their sire up to the
            place of Man: To make the way easier from Hell to this world to and fro, they pave
            a broad highway, or bridge over Choas[sic], according to the tract that Satan first
            made; then preparing for Earth, they meet him, proud of his success, returning to
            Hell; their mutual gratulation. Satan arrives at Pandemonium, in full assembly relates
            with boasting his success against Man; instead of applause is entertained with a general
            hiss by all his audience, transformed with himself also suddenly into serpents, according
            to his doom given in Paradise; then, deluded with a shew of the forbidden tree springing
            up before them, they, greedily reaching to take of the fruit, chew dust and bitter
            ashes. The proceedings of Sin and Death: God foretells the final victory of his Son
            over them, and the renewing of all things; but, for the present, commands his Angels
            to make several alterations in the heavens and elements. Adam, more and more perceiving
            his fallen condition, heavily bewails, rejects the condolement of Eve; she persists,
            and at length appeases him: then, to evade the curse likely to fall on their offspring,
            proposes to Adam violent ways, which he approves not; but, conceiving better hope,
            puts her in mind of the late promise made them, that her seed should be revenged on
            the Serpent; and exhorts her with him to seek peace of the offended Deity, by repentance
            and supplication.</span><br>

            Myself the total crime, or to accuse<br>
            My other self, the partner of my life;<br>
            Whose failing, while her faith to me remains, <br>

            This Woman, whom thou madest to be my help, <br>

            So fit, so acceptable, so divine, <br>

            Superior, or but equal, that to her<br>
            Thou didst resign thy manhood, and the place<br>
            Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, <br>
            And for her, whose perfection far excell'd <br>
            Hers in all real dignity? Adorn'd <br>
            She was indeed, and lovely, to attract<br>
            Thy love, not thy subjection; and her gifts<br>
            Were such, as under government well seem'd; <br>
            Unseemly to bear rule; which was thy part<br>
            And person, hadst thou known thyself aright. <br>

            Easing their passage hence, for intercourse, <br>
            Or transmigration, as their lot shall lead. <br>
            Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn<br>

            The way, thou leading; such a scent I draw<br>
            Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br>
            The savor of Death from all things there that live: <br>
            Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest<br>

            Met, who to meet him came, his offspring dear.<br>
            Great joy was at their meeting, and at sight<br>
            Of that stupendous bridge, his joy increased. <br>
            Long he admiring stood, till Sin, his fair<br>
            Inchanting daughter, thus the silence broke. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   O Parent, these are they magnific deeds, <br>
            Thy trophies, which thou viewst as not thine own; <br>
            Thou are their author, and prime architect, <br>
            For I no sooner in my heart divined, <br>
            My heart which by a secret harmony<br>
            Still moves with thine, join'd in connection sweet, <br>
            That thou on Earth hadst prosper'd, which thy looks<br>
            Now also evidence, but straight I felt, <br>
            Though distant from thee, worlds between, yet felt, <br>
            That I must after thee with this thy son; <br>
            Such fatal consequence unites us three! <br>
            Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, <br>
            Nor <span class="single_underline ">this unvoyageable gulf obscure</span><br>
            Detain from following thy illustrious tract. <br>
            Thou has achieved our liberty, confined<br>
            Within Hell-gates till now; thou hast empower'd<br>
            To fortify thus far, <span class="single_underline ">and overlay</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">With this portentous bridge the dark abyss</span>.<br>
            Thine now is all this world; thy virtue hath won<br>
            What thy hands builded not; thy wisdom gain'd, <br>
            With odds, what war hath lost, and fully avenged<br>
            Our foil in Heaven; here thou shalt monarch reign, <br>
            There didst not; there let him still victor sway, <br>
            As battle hath adjudged; from this new world<br>
            Retiring, by his own doom alienated;<br>
            And henceforth monarchy with thee divide<br>
            Of all things parted by the empyreal bounds, <br>
            His quadrature, from thy orbicular world; <br>
            Or try thee, now more dangerous to his throne.<br>

            Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grand-child both, <br>
            High proof ye now have given to be the race<br>
            Of Satan, (for I glory in the name,<br>
            Antagonist of Heaven's Almighty King), <br>
            Amply have merited of me, of all<br>

            Triumphal with triumphal act have met, <br>
            Mine, with this glorious work, and made one realm, <br>
            Hell and this world, one realm, one continent<br>
            Of easy thoroughfare. Therefore, while I <br>
            Descend through darkness, on your road with ease, <br>
            To my associate Powers, them to acquaint<br>
            With these successes, and with them rejoice; <br>
            You two this way, among these numerous orbs, <br>
            All yours, right down to Paradise descend; <br>
            There dwell, and reign in bliss; thence on the Earth<br>
            Dominion exercise and in the air. <br>
            Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declared; <br>
            Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. <br>
            My substitutes I send ye, and create<br>
            Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might<br>
            Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now<br>
            My hold of this new kingdom all depends, <br>
            Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit. <br>
            If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell<br>
            No detriment need fear; go, and be strong. <br>

            Cast on themselves from their own mouths. There stood<br>
            A grove hard by, sprung with this their change, <br>
            His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br>
            Their penance, laden with fair fruit, like that<br>

            Now risen, to work them further woe or shame; <br>
            Yet, parch'd with scalding thirst, and hunger fierce. <br>
            Though to delude them sent, could not abstain; <br>
            But on they rolled in heaps, and, <span class="single_underline ">up the trees</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Climbing, sat thicker than the snaky locks</span><br>

            From darkness to promote me, or here place<br>
            In this delicious garden? As my will<br>

            Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold<br>
            The good I sought not. To the loss of that, <br>
            Sufficient penalty, why hast thou added <br>
            The sense of endless woes? Inexplicable <br>
            Thy justice seems; yet, to say truth, too late<br>
            I thus contest; then should have been refused <br>
            Those terms, whatever, when they were proposed:<br>
            Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, <br>
            Then cavil the conditions? and, though God<br>
            Made thee without thy leave, what if thy son<br>
            Prove disobedient, and, reproved, retort, <br>
            "Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:"<br>
            Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee<br>
            That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, <br>
            But natural necessity, begot. <br>
            God made thee of choice his own, and of his own <br>
            To serve him; thy reward was of his grace;<br>
            Thy punishment then justly is at his will. <br>
            Be it so, for I submit; his doom is fair, <br>
            That dust I am, and shall to dust return: <br>
            O welcome hour whenever! Why delays<br>
            His hand to execute what his decree<br>
            Fix'd on this day? Why do I overlive? <br>
            Why am I mock'd with death, and lengthen'd out<br>
            To deathless pain? How gladly would I meet<br>
            Mortality my sentence, and be earth<br>
            Insensible! how glad would lay me down <br>
            As in my mother's lap! There I should rest <br>

            But I shall die a living death? O thought<br>
            Horrid, if true! yet, why? it was but breath<br>
            Of life that sinn'd; what dies but what had life<br>

            All of me then shall die: let this appease <br>
            The doubt, since human reach no further knows. <br>
            For though the Lord of all be infinite, <br>
            Is his wrath also? Be it, Man is not so, <br>
            But mortal doom'd. How can he exercise <br>
            Wrath without end on Man whom death must end? <br>
            Can he make deathless death? That were to make <br>
            Strange contradiction, which to God himself <br>
            Impossible is held, as argument<br>

            In punish'd Man, to satisfy his rigour,<br>
            Satisfied never? That were to extend <br>

            Bereaving sense, but endless misery<br>
            From this day onward; which I feel begun<br>
            Both in me, and without me; and so last<br>
            To perpetuity; Ay me! that fear <br>
            Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution <br>

            Than all the world much heavier, though divided<br>
            With that bad Woman? Thus, what thou desires, <br>
            And what thou fearst, alike destroys all hope <br>
            Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br>

            Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br>
            For loss of life and pleasure overloved. <br>
            Or if thou covet death, as utmost end<br>

            The penalty pronounced; doubt not but God<br>
            Hath wiselier arm'd his vengeful ire, than so <br>
            To be forestall'd; much more I fear lest death, <br>

            We are by doom to pay; rather such acts<br>

            Without wrath or reviling; we expected<br>
            Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br>
            Was meant by death that day; when lo! to thee<br>
            Pains only in child-bearing were foretold, <br>
            And bringing forth; soon recompensed with joy, <br>
            Fruit of thy womb: On me <span class="single_underline ">the curse aslope</span><br>

            My labour will sustain me; and, lest cold<br>
            Or heat should injure us, his timely care<br>
            Hath, unbesought, provided; and his hands<br>
            Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged;<br>
            How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br>
            Be open, and his heart to pity incline, <br>
            And teach us further by what means to shun<br>
            The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow? <br>

            Strength added from above; new hope to spring<br>
            Out of despair; joy, but with fear yet link'd;<br>
            Which thus to Eve his welcome words renew'd. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   Eve, easily may faith admit, that all<br>
            The good which we enjoy, from Heaven descends; <br>
            But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven, <br>
            So prevalent as to concern the mind <br>
            Of God high blest, or to incline his will, <br>
            Hard to belief may seem; yet this will prayer <br>
            Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne<br>
            Even to the seat of God. For since I sought <br>
            By prayer the offended Deity to appease; <br>
            Kneel'd, and before him humbled all my heart; <br>
            Methought I saw him placable and mild, <br>
            Bending his ear; persuasion in me grew<br>
            That I was heard with favour; peace return'd <br>
            Home to my breast, and to my memory<br>
            His promise, that thy seed shall bruise our foe; <br>
            Which, then not minded in dismay, yet now <br>
            Assures me that the bitterness of death<br>
            Is past, and we shall live. Whence hail to thee, <br>
            Eve rightly call'd, mother of all mankind, <br>
            Mother of all things living, since by thee<br>
            Man is to live; and all things live for Man. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   To whom thus Eve with sad demeanor meek. <br>
            Ill-worthy I such title should belong<br>
            To me transgressor; who, for thee ordain'd<br>
            A help, became they snare; to me reproach <br>

            Possession of the garden; he alone, <br>
            To find where Adam shelter'd, took his way, <br>
            Not unperceived of Adam; who to Eve, <br>
            While the great visitant approach'd, thus spake. <br>

            But solemn, and sublime; whom not to offend, <br>
            With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.<br>

            To thee, and to thy offspring, good with bad<br>
            Expect to hear; supernal grace contending<br>
            With sinfulness of men; thereby to learn<br>
            True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br>
            And pious sorrow; equally enured <br>
            By moderation either state to bear, <br>
            Prosperous, or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br>
            Safest thy life, and best prepared endure<br>
            Thy mortal passage when it comes.—Ascend<br>
            This hill; let Eve (for I have drenched her eyes)<br>
            Here sleep below; while thou to foresight wakest; <br>
            As once thou sleeps, while she to life was form'd. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   To whom thus Adam gratefully replied. <br>
            Ascend, I follow thee, safe guide, the path<br>
            Thou leadst me; and to the hand of Heaven submit, <br>
            However chastening; to the evil turn<br>
            My obvious breast; arming to overcome<br>
            By suffering, and earn rest from labour won, <br>
            If so I may attain.—<span class="single_underline ">So both ascend</span><br>

            Stretch'd out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. <br>

            Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced; <br>
            But him the gentle Angel by the hand<br>

            Corruption, to bring forth more violent deeds. <br>
            <span class="left_vertical "><span class="tab_space">   </span>   His eyes he open'd, and beheld a field, </span><br>

            <span class="left_vertical ">In the midst an altar as the land-mark stood, </span><br>
            <span class="left_vertical ">Rustic, of grassy sord; thither anon</span><br>
            <span class="left_vertical ">A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought</span><br>

            <span class="left_vertical ">Choicest and best; then, sacrificing, laid</span><br>
            The inwards and their fat, with incenses strow'd, <br>
            On the cleft wood, and all due rites perform'd. <br>
            His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven<br>
            Consumed with nimble glance, and grateful steam; <br>
            The other's not, for his was not sincere; <br>
            Whereat he inly raged, and, as they talk'd, <br>
            Smote him into the midriff with a stone<br>
            That beat out life: he fell; and, deadly pale, <br>
            Groan'd out his soul with gushing blood effused. <br>
            Much at that sight was Adam in his heart<br>
            Dismay'd, and thus in haste to the Angel cried. <br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   O Teacher, some great mischief hath befallen <br>
            To that meek man, who well hath sacrificed; <br>

            To some cave's mouth; or whether wash'd by stream<br>
            From under ground) the liquid ore he drain'd <br>
            Into fit moulds prepared; from which he form'd <br>
            First his own tools; then, what might else be wrought<br>
            Fusile or graven in metal. After these, <br>
            But on the hither side, a different sort<br>
            From the high neighboring hills, which was their seat<br>
            Down to the plain descended: by their guise, <br>
            Just men they seem'd, and all their study bent<br>
            To worship God aright, and know his works<br>
            Not hid; nor those things last, which might preserve<br>
            Freedom and peace to men: they on the plain<br>
            Long had not walk'd, when, from the tents behold!<br>
            A bevy of fair women, richly gay<br>
            In gems and wanton dress; to the harp they sung<br>
            Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on. <br>
            The men, tho' grave, eyed them, and let their eyes<br>
            Rove without rein, till in the amorous net<br>
            Fast caught, they liked, and each his liking chose; <br>
            And now of love they treat, till the evening star, <br>
            Love's harbinger, appear'd; then, all in heat, <br>
            They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke<br>
            Hymen, then first to marriage-rites invoked; <br>
            With feast and music all the tents resound. <br>
            Such happy interview and fair event, <br>
            Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers, <br>
            And charming symphonies, attach'd the heart<br>

            Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse; <br>

            Those tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the tents<br>

            Unmindful of their Maker, though his Spirit<br>
            Taught them; but they his gifts acknowledge none. <br>
            Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget; <br>
            For that fair female troop thou sawst, that seem'd <br>
            Of goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, <br>
            Yet empty of all good wherein consists <br>
            Woman's domestic honor and chief praise; <br>
            Bred only and completed to the taste<br>
            Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, <br>
            To dress, and troll the tongue, and roll the eye; <br>
            To these, that sober race of men, whose lives<br>
            Religious titled them the songs of God, <br>
            Shall yield up all their virtue, all their fame<br>
            Ignobly, to the trains and to the smiles, <br>
            Of these fair atheists: and now swim in joy, <br>
            Ere long to swim at large; and laugh, for which<br>

            Paths indirect, or in the midway faint! <br>

            Adam was all in tears, and to his guide<br>

            Death's ministers, not men, who thus deal death<br>
            Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br>
            Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew<br>
            His brother: for of whom such massacre<br>

            Such were these Giants, men of high renown; <br>

            And valour and heroic virtue call'd; <br>
            To overcome in battle, and subdue<br>

            Of triumph, to be styled great conquerors, <br>
            Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods, <br>
            Destroyers rightlier call'd, and plagues of men. <br>

            Frequented their assemblies, whereso met, <br>
            Triumphs or festivals, and to them preach'd <br>
            Conversion and repentance, as to souls<br>
            In prison, under judgments imminent: <br>
            But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased<br>
            Contending, and removed his tents far off; <br>
            Then from the mountain hewing timber tall, <br>
            Began to build a vessel of huge bulk, <br>
            Measured by cubit, length, and breath, and height, <br>
            Smear'd round with pitch, and in the side a door<br>
            Contrived, and of provisions laid in large<br>
            For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!<br>
            Of every beast, and bird, and insect small<br>
            Came sevens, and pairs, and entered in as taught<br>
            Their order: last the Sire, and his three sons, <br>
            With their four wives; and God made fast the door. <br>

            And one peculiar nation to select<br>
            From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,<br>

            Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,<br>
            Bred up in idol-worship; O, that men<br>
            (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br>
            While yet the patriarch lived, who 'scaped the flood,<br>
            As to forsake the living God, and fall<br>
            To worship their own work in wood and stone<br>
            For Gods! yet him God the Most High vouchsafes<br>
            To call by vision from his father's house,<br>
            His kindred, and false Gods, into a land<br>
            Which he will show him; and from him will raise <br>
            A mighty nation; and upon him shower<br>
            His benediction so, that in his seed<br>
            All nations shall be blest; he straight obeys,<br>
            Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:<br>
            I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith <br>
            <span class="single_underline ">He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,</span><br>

            Hail mix'd with fire, must rend the Egyptian sky,<br>

            Their government, and their great senate choose<br>

            Among whom God will deign to dwell on Earth,<br>
            So many and so various laws are given;<br>
            So many laws argue so many sins<br>
            Among them; how can God with such reside?<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin<br>
            Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br>

            Their natural pravity, by stirring up<br>
            Sin against law to fight: that when they see<br>
            Law can discover sin, but not remove,<br>
            Save by those shadowy expiations weak,<br>
            The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude<br>
            Some blood more precious must be paid for Man;<br>
            Just for unjust; that, in such righteousness,<br>
            To them by faith imputed, they may find<br>
            Justification towards God, and peace<br>
            Of conscience, which the law by ceremonies<br>
            Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part <br>
            Perform, and not performing cannot live.<br>
            So law appears imperfect, and but given <br>
            With purpose to resign them, in full time,<br>
            Up to a better covenant, disciplined<br>
            From shadowy types to truth; from flesh to spirit;<br>

            Acceptance of large grace; from servile fear<br>
            To filial; works of law to works of faith.<br>
            And therefore shall not Moses, though of God<br>
            Highly beloved, being but the minister<br>
            Of law, his people into Canaan lead;<br>

            Barr'd of his right; yet at his birth a star<br>
            Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come;<br>
            And guides the eastern sages, who inquire<br>
            His place, to offer incense, myrrh, and gold.<br>
            His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br>
            To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br>

            Of squadron'd Angels hear his carol sung.<br>
            A virgin is his mother, but his sire<br>
            The power of the Most High: He shall ascend<br>
            The throne hereditary, and bound his reign<br>
            With Earth's wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.<br>

            Surcharged, as had like grief been dew'd in tears,<br>
            Without the vent of words; which these he breathed:<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br>

            High in the love of Heaven; yet from my loins,<br>

            Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,<br>

            Salvation shall be preach'd, but to the sons<br>
            Of Abraham's faith wherever through the world:<br>
            So in his seed all nations shall be bless'd.<br>
            Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend<br>
            With victory, triumphing through the air<br>
            Over his foes and thine. There shall surprise<br>

            Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring;<br>
            To God more glory, more good-will to Men<br>
            From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.<br>
            But say, if our Deliverer up to Heaven<br>
            Must reascend, what will betide the few,<br>
            His faithful, left among the unfaithful herd,<br>
            The enemies of truth? Who then shall guide <br>
            His people, who defend? Will they not deal<br>
            Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   Besure they will, said the Angel; but from Heaven<br>

            Chiefly, what may concern her faith to know,<br>
            The great deliverance by her seed to come<br>
            (For by the Woman's seed) on all mankind;<br>
            That ye may live, which will be many days,<br>
            Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,<br>
            With cause for evils past; yet much more cheer'd<br>
            With meditation on the happy end.<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   He ended, and they both descend the hill;<br>
            Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve<br>
            Lay sleeping, ran before, but found her waked;<br>
            And thus with words not sad she him received:<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   When thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know;<br>
            For God is also in sleep, and dreams advise,<br>
            Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br>
            Presaging, since with sorrow and heart's distress<br>
            Wearied I fell asleep: But now lead on;<br>
            In me is no delay; with thee to go<br>
            Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,<br>
            Is to go hence unwillingly; thou to me<br>
            Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,<br>
            Who for my wilful crime art banish'd hence.<br>
            This further consolation yet secure<br>
            I carry hence; though all by me is lost,<br>
            Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,<br>
            By me the promised Seed shall all restore.<br>
            <span class="tab_space">   </span>   So spake our mother Eve, and Adam heard<br>
            Well pleased, but answered not; for now too nigh<br>
            The Arch-Angel stood; and, from the other hill<br>
            To their fix'd station, all in bright array<br>
            The Cherubim descended; <span class="single_underline ">on the ground</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Gliding meteorous, as evening mist</span><br>

            <span class="single_underline ">And gathers ground fast at the labourer's heel</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Homeward returning. High in front advanced,</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">The brandish'd sword of God before them blazed</span><br>
            <span class="single_underline ">Fierce as a comet; which with torrid heat,</span><br>
